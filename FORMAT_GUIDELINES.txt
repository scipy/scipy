Follow the standard Python formatting rules when writing code for SciPy.  Guido 
describes them "here":http://www.python.org/doc/essays/styleguide.html.  A few 
reminders follow:

   o Use 4 spaces for indentation levels.  Do not use tabs as they can result 
     in indentation confusion.  Most editors have a feature that will insert 4 
     spaces when the tab key is hit.  Also, many editors will automatically 
     search/replace leading tabs with 4 spaces.

   o Only 80 characters on a line.

   o use all lowercase function/class names with underscore separated words:

        def set_some_value()

     instead of:

        def setSomeValue()

     There is no differentiation between classes, functions, verbs, nouns, etc. 
     This simple scheme aims to make it easier for non-programmers to become 
     familiar with the interface.  For those that object, you are skilled 
     enough to deal with the limitation.
