<!--
This configuration file is no longer required and may be removed.

In older versions of dbus, this file defined the behaviour of the well-known
session bus. That behaviour is now determined by
/workspaces/scipy/venv/share/dbus-1/session.conf, which should not be edited.

For local configuration changes, create a file
session-local.conf or files matching session.d/*.conf in the same directory
as this one, with a <busconfig> element containing configuration directives.
These directives can override D-Bus or OS defaults.

For upstream or distribution-wide defaults that can be overridden
by a local sysadmin, create files matching
/workspaces/scipy/venv/share/dbus-1/session.d/*.conf instead.
