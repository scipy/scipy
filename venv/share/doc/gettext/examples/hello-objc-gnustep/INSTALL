This example relies on:
  - the GNUstep libraries (libgnustep-gui, libgnustep-base)
    and their dependencies (libiconv or glibc, and ffcall)
  - the Objective C runtime libraries (libobjc)

GNUstep applications don't need to be configured or installed in order to run;
all you need is to
  - Prepare your environment, as described in the GNUstep-HOWTO. E.g.
    . /usr/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
  - ./autogen.sh
  - make
  - openapp ./Hello
Cleanup:
  - make distclean
  - ./autoclean.sh
