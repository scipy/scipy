<br><a name="SEC1" href="#TOC1">PCRE2 REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX SUMMARY</a><br>
<P>
The full syntax and semantics of the regular expressions that are supported by
PCRE2 are described in the
<a href="pcre2pattern.html"><b>pcre2pattern</b></a>
documentation. This document contains a quick-reference summary of the syntax.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC2" href="#TOC1">QUOTING</a><br>
<P>
<pre>
  \x         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
  \Q...\E    treat enclosed characters as literal
</PRE>
</P>
<br><a name="SEC3" href="#TOC1">ESCAPED CHARACTERS</a><br>
<P>
This table applies to ASCII and Unicode environments. An unrecognized escape
sequence causes an error.
<pre>
  \a         alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
  \cx        "control-x", where x is any ASCII printing character
  \e         escape (hex 1B)
  \f         form feed (hex 0C)
  \n         newline (hex 0A)
  \r         carriage return (hex 0D)
  \t         tab (hex 09)
  \0dd       character with octal code 0dd
  \ddd       character with octal code ddd, or backreference
  \o{ddd..}  character with octal code ddd..
  \N{U+hh..} character with Unicode code point hh.. (Unicode mode only)
  \xhh       character with hex code hh
  \x{hh..}   character with hex code hh..
</pre>
If PCRE2_ALT_BSUX or PCRE2_EXTRA_ALT_BSUX is set ("ALT_BSUX mode"), the
following are also recognized:
<pre>
  \U         the character "U"
  \uhhhh     character with hex code hhhh
  \u{hh..}   character with hex code hh.. but only for EXTRA_ALT_BSUX
</pre>
When \x is not followed by {, from zero to two hexadecimal digits are read,
but in ALT_BSUX mode \x must be followed by two hexadecimal digits to be
recognized as a hexadecimal escape; otherwise it matches a literal "x".
Likewise, if \u (in ALT_BSUX mode) is not followed by four hexadecimal digits
or (in EXTRA_ALT_BSUX mode) a sequence of hex digits in curly brackets, it
matches a literal "u".
</P>
<P>
Note that \0dd is always an octal code. The treatment of backslash followed by
a non-zero digit is complicated; for details see the section
<a href="pcre2pattern.html#digitsafterbackslash">"Non-printing characters"</a>
in the
<a href="pcre2pattern.html"><b>pcre2pattern</b></a>
documentation, where details of escape processing in EBCDIC environments are
also given. \N{U+hh..} is synonymous with \x{hh..} in PCRE2 but is not
supported in EBCDIC environments. Note that \N not followed by an opening
curly bracket has a different meaning (see below).
</P>
<br><a name="SEC4" href="#TOC1">CHARACTER TYPES</a><br>
<P>
<pre>
  .          any character except newline;
               in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
  \C         one code unit, even in UTF mode (best avoided)
  \d         a decimal digit
  \D         a character that is not a decimal digit
  \h         a horizontal white space character
  \H         a character that is not a horizontal white space character
  \N         a character that is not a newline
  \p{<i>xx</i>}     a character with the <i>xx</i> property
  \P{<i>xx</i>}     a character without the <i>xx</i> property
  \R         a newline sequence
  \s         a white space character
  \S         a character that is not a white space character
  \v         a vertical white space character
  \V         a character that is not a vertical white space character
  \w         a "word" character
  \W         a "non-word" character
  \X         a Unicode extended grapheme cluster
</pre>
\C is dangerous because it may leave the current matching point in the middle
of a UTF-8 or UTF-16 character. The application can lock out the use of \C by
setting the PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option. It is also possible to build PCRE2
with the use of \C permanently disabled.
</P>
<P>
By default, \d, \s, and \w match only ASCII characters, even in UTF-8 mode
or in the 16-bit and 32-bit libraries. However, if locale-specific matching is
happening, \s and \w may also match characters with code points in the range
128-255. If the PCRE2_UCP option is set, the behaviour of these escape
sequences is changed to use Unicode properties and they match many more
characters.
</P>
<P>
Property descriptions in \p and \P are matched caselessly; hyphens,
underscores, and white space are ignored, in accordance with Unicode's "loose
matching" rules.

<br><a name="SEC7" href="#TOC1">BINARY PROPERTIES FOR \p AND \P</a><br>
<P>
Unicode defines a number of binary properties, that is, properties whose only
values are true or false. You can obtain a list of those that are recognized by
\p and \P, along with their abbreviations, by running this command:
<pre>
  pcre2test -LP
</PRE>
</P>
<br><a name="SEC8" href="#TOC1">SCRIPT MATCHING WITH \p AND \P</a><br>
<P>
Many script names and their 4-letter abbreviations are recognized in
\p{sc:...} or \p{scx:...} items, or on their own with \p (and also \P of
course). You can obtain a list of these scripts by running this command:
<pre>

\K is honoured in positive assertions, but ignored in negative ones.

<P>
<pre>
  (?(condition)yes-pattern)
  (?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)

  (?(n)               absolute reference condition
  (?(+n)              relative reference condition
  (?(-n)              relative reference condition
  (?(&#60;name&#62;)          named reference condition (Perl)
  (?('name')          named reference condition (Perl)
  (?(name)            named reference condition (PCRE2, deprecated)
  (?(R)               overall recursion condition
  (?(Rn)              specific numbered group recursion condition
  (?(R&name)          specific named group recursion condition
  (?(DEFINE)          define groups for reference
  (?(VERSION[&#62;]=n.m)  test PCRE2 version
  (?(assert)          assertion condition
</pre>
Note the ambiguity of (?(R) and (?(Rn) which might be named reference
conditions or recursion tests. Such a condition is interpreted as a reference
condition if the relevant named group exists.

<br><a name="SEC27" href="#TOC1">BACKTRACKING CONTROL</a><br>
<P>
All backtracking control verbs may be in the form (*VERB:NAME). For (*MARK) the
name is mandatory, for the others it is optional. (*SKIP) changes its behaviour
if :NAME is present. The others just set a name for passing back to the caller,
but this is not a name that (*SKIP) can see. The following act immediately they
are reached:
<pre>
  (*ACCEPT)       force successful match
  (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)
  (*MARK:NAME)    set name to be passed back; synonym (*:NAME)
</pre>
The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a backtrack to
reach them. They all force a match failure, but they differ in what happens
afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do so only if the
pattern is not anchored.
<pre>
  (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
  (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
  (*SKIP)         advance to current matching position
  (*SKIP:NAME)    advance to position corresponding to an earlier
                  (*MARK:NAME); if not found, the (*SKIP) is ignored
  (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation
</pre>
The effect of one of these verbs in a group called as a subroutine is confined
to the subroutine call.
</P>
<br><a name="SEC28" href="#TOC1">CALLOUTS</a><br>
<P>
<pre>
  (?C)            callout (assumed number 0)
  (?Cn)           callout with numerical data n
  (?C"text")      callout with string data
</pre>
The allowed string delimiters are ` ' " ^ % # $ (which are the same for the
start and the end), and the starting delimiter { matched with the ending
delimiter }. To encode the ending delimiter within the string, double it.
