.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR cap_get_proc ()
allocates a capability state in working storage, sets its state to
that of the calling process, and returns a pointer to this newly
created capability state.  The caller should free any releasable
memory, when the capability state in working storage is no longer
required, by calling
.BR cap_free ()
with the
.I cap_t
as an argument.
.PP
.BR cap_set_proc ()
sets the values for all capability flags for all capabilities to the
capability state identified by
.IR cap_p .
The new capability state of the process will be completely determined by
the contents of
.I cap_p
upon successful return from this function.  If any flag in
.I cap_p
is set for any capability not currently permitted for the calling process,
the function will fail, and the capability state of the process will remain
unchanged.
.PP
.BR cap_get_pid ()
returns a
.IR cap_t ,
see 
.BR cap_init (3),
with the process capabilities of the process known to the caller as
.IR pid .
If
.I pid
is 0, then the calling process's capabilities are returned.
This information can also be obtained from the
.I /proc/<pid>/status
file. (The entries in that file can be translated with the
.BI "capsh \-\-decode=" XXX
command line.) When the caller is operating within a
.RB ( CLONE_NEWPID )
namespace, the numerical
.I pid
argument is interpreted in the range of that namespace. As such, the
caller's idea of the target
.I pid
may differ from that of the target process when they are operating in
different pid namespaces. See
.BR pid_namespaces (7)
for details.
Further, the returned
.I cap_t
value holds the capabilities that the target
.I pid
thinks it has. If the target is operating in a
.RB ( CLONE_NEWUSER )
namespace, the system wide privilege of those user namespace
capabilities my be substantially reduced. See
.BR user_namespaces (7)
for details.
.PP
.BR cap_get_bound ()
with a
.I  cap
as an argument returns the current value of this bounding set
capability flag in effect for the calling process. This operation is
unprivileged. Note, a macro function
.BR "CAP_IS_SUPPORTED(cap_value_t " cap )
is provided that evaluates to true (1) if the system supports the
specified capability,
.IR cap .
If the system does not support the capability, this function returns
0. This macro works by testing for an error condition with
.BR cap_get_bound ().
.PP
.BR cap_drop_bound ()
can be used to lower the specified bounding set capability,
.BR cap .
To complete successfully, the prevailing
.I effective
capability set must have a raised
.BR CAP_SETPCAP .
.PP
.BR cap_get_ambient ()
returns the prevailing value of the specified ambient capability, or
-1 if the capability is not supported by the running kernel.  A macro
.BR CAP_AMBIENT_SUPPORTED ()
uses this function to determine if ambient capabilities are supported
by the kernel.
.PP
.BR cap_set_ambient ()
sets the specified ambient capability to a specific value. To complete
successfully, the prevailing
.I effective
capability set must have a raised
.BR CAP_SETPCAP .
Further, to raise a specific ambient capability the
.IR inheritable " and " permitted
sets of the calling process must contain the specified capability, and
raised ambient bits will only be retained as long as this remains true.
.PP
.BR cap_reset_ambient ()
resets all of the ambient capabilities for the calling process to
their lowered value. Note, the ambient set is intended to operate in a
legacy environment where the application has limited awareness of
capabilities in general. Executing a file, with associated filesystem
capabilities, the kernel will implicitly reset the ambient set of the
process. Further, changes to the inheritable set by the program code
without explicitly fixing up the ambient set can also drop ambient
bits.
.PP
.BR cap_get_secbits ()
returns the securebits of the calling process. These bits affect the
way in which the calling process implements things like setuid-root
fixup and ambient capabilities.
.PP
.BR cap_set_secbits ()
attempts to modify the securebits of the calling process. Note
.B CAP_SETPCAP
must be in the effective capability set for this to be effective. Some
settings lock the sub-states of the securebits, so attempts to set values
may be denied by the kernel even when the
.B CAP_SETPCAP
capability is raised.
.PP
To help manage the complexity of the securebits, libcap provides a
combined securebit and capability set concept called a libcap mode.
.BR cap_get_mode ()
attempts to summarize the prevailing security environment in the form
of a numerical
.B cap_mode_t
value. A text representation of the mode can be obtained via the
.BR cap_mode_name ()
function. The vast majority of combinations of these values are not well
defined in terms of a libcap mode, and for these states
.BR cap_get_mode ()
returns
.RB ( cap_mode_t )0
which
.BR cap_get_name ()
identifies as
.RI `` UNCERTAIN ''.
Supported modes are:
.BR CAP_MODE_NOPRIV ", " CAP_MODE_PURE1E_INIT " and " CAP_MODE_PURE1E .
.PP
.BR cap_prctl ()
can be used to read state via the \fBprctl\fI()\fP system call.
.PP
.BR cap_prctlw ()
can be used to write state via the \fBprctl\fI()\fP system call.
.PP
.BR cap_set_mode ()
can be used to set the desired mode. The permitted capability
.B CAP_SETPCAP
is required for this function to succeed.
.PP
.BR cap_setuid ()
is a convenience function for the
.BR setuid (2)
system call. Where
.BR cap_setuid ()
arranges for the right effective capability to be raised in order to
perform the system call, and also arranges to preserve the
availability of permitted capabilities after the uid has
changed. Following this call all effective capabilities are lowered.
.PP
.BR cap_setgroups ()
is a convenience function for performing both
.BR setgid (2)
and
.BR setgroups (2)
calls in one call. The
.BR cap_setgroups ()
call raises the right effective capability for the duration of the
call, and empties the effective capability set before returning.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The functions
.BR cap_get_proc ()
and
.BR cap_get_pid ()
return a non-NULL value on success, and NULL on failure.
.PP
The function
.BR cap_get_bound ()
returns \-1 if the requested capability is unknown, otherwise the
return value reflects the current state of that capability in the
prevailing bounding set. Note, a macro function,
.PP
The all of the setting functions such as
.BR cap_set_proc ()
and
.BR cap_drop_bound ()
return zero for success, and \-1 on failure.
.PP
On failure,
.I errno
is set to
.BR EINVAL ,
.BR EPERM ,
or
.BR ENOMEM .
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
.BR cap_set_proc ()
and
.BR cap_get_proc ()
are specified in the withdrawn POSIX.1e draft specification.
.BR cap_get_pid ()
is a Linux extension.
.SH "NOTES"
Neither glibc, nor the Linux kernel honors POSIX semantics for setting
capabilities and securebits in the presence of pthreads. That is,
changing capability sets, by default, only affect the running
thread. To be meaningfully secure, however, the capability sets should
be mirrored by all threads within a common program because threads are
not memory isolated. As a workaround for this,
.B libcap
is packaged with a separate POSIX semantics system call library:
.BR libpsx .
If your program uses POSIX threads, to achieve meaningful POSIX
semantics capability manipulation, you should link your program with:
.sp
.B ld ... \-lcap \-lpsx \-lpthread \-\-wrap=pthread_create
.sp
or,
.sp
.B gcc ... \-lcap \-lpsx \-lpthread \-Wl,\-wrap,pthread_create
.sp
When linked this way, due to linker magic, libcap uses
.BR psx_syscall "(3) and " psx_syscall6 (3)
to perform state setting system calls. Notably, this also ensures that
.BI cap_prctlw ()
can be used to ensure process control bits are shared over all threads
of a single process.
.SS capgetp() and capsetp()
The library also supports the deprecated functions:
.PP
.BI "int capgetp(pid_t " pid ", cap_t " cap_d );
.PP
.BI "int capsetp(pid_t " pid ", cap_t " cap_d );
.PP
.BR capgetp ()
attempts to obtain the capabilities of some other process; storing the
capabilities in a pre-allocated
.IR cap_d .
See
.BR cap_init ()
for information on allocating an empty capability set. This function
is deprecated; you should use
.BR cap_get_pid ().
.PP
.BR capsetp ()
attempts to set the capabilities of the calling process or of
some other process(es),
.IR pid .
Note that setting capabilities of another process is only possible on older
kernels that do not provide VFS support for setting file capabilities.
See
.BR capset (2)
for information on which kernels provide such support.
.PP
If
.I pid
is positive it refers to a specific process;  if it is zero, it refers
to the calling process; \-1 refers to all processes other than the
calling process and process '1' (typically 
.BR init (8));
other negative values refer to the
.I \-pid
process group.
.PP
In order to use this function, the kernel must support
it and the calling process must have
.B CAP_SETPCAP
raised in its Effective capability set. The capabilities set in the
target process(es) are those contained in
.IR cap_d .
.PP
Kernels that support filesystem capabilities redefine the semantics of
.B CAP_SETPCAP
and on such systems,
.BR capsetp ()
will always fail for any target not
equal to the calling process.
.BR capsetp ()
returns zero for success, and \-1 on failure.
.PP
On kernels where it is (was) supported,
.BR capsetp ()
should be used with care.  It existed, primarily, to overcome an early
lack of support for capabilities in the filesystems supported by
Linux.  Note that on older kernels where
.BR capsetp ()
could be used to set the capabilities of another process,
the only processes that had
.B CAP_SETPCAP
available to them by default were processes started as kernel threads.
(Typically this includes
.BR init (8),
kflushd and kswapd.) A kernel recompilation was needed to modify
this default.
.SH EXAMPLE
The code segment below raises the
.B CAP_FOWNER
and
.B CAP_SETFCAP
effective capabilities for the caller:
.nf

    ...
    cap_t caps;
    const cap_value_t cap_list[2] = {CAP_FOWNER, CAP_SETFCAP};

    if (!CAP_IS_SUPPORTED(CAP_SETFCAP))
        /* handle error */

    caps = cap_get_proc();
    if (caps == NULL)
        /* handle error */;

    if (cap_set_flag(caps, CAP_EFFECTIVE, 2, cap_list, CAP_SET) == \-1)
        /* handle error */;

    if (cap_set_proc(caps) == \-1)
        /* handle error */;

    if (cap_free(caps) == \-1)
        /* handle error */;
    ...

.fi
Alternatively, to completely drop privilege in a program launched
setuid-root but wanting to run as a specific user ID etc. in such a
way that neither it, nor any of its children can acquire privilege
again:
.nf

    ...
    uid_t nobody = 65534;
    const gid_t groups[] = {65534};

    if (cap_setgroups(groups[0], 1, groups) != 0)
        /* handle error */;
    if (cap_setuid(nobody) != 0)
        /* handle error */;

    /*
     * privilege is still available here
     */

    if (cap_set_mode(CAP_MODE_NOPRIV) != 0)
        /* handle error */
    ...

.fi
Note, the above sequence can be performed by the
.B capsh
tool as follows:
.sp
.B sudo capsh \-\-user=nobody \-\-mode=NOPRIV \-\-print
.sp
where
.B \-\-print
displays the resulting privilege state.
