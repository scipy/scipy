.SH NAME
captree \- display tree of process capabilities
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR captree " [OPTIONS] "
.RI [( pid | glob-name ") ...]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B captree
displays the capabilities on the mentioned processes indicated by
.IR pid " or " glob-name
value(s) given on the command line. If no
.I pid
etc values are supplied,
.IR pid =1
is implied. A
.I pid
value of 0 displays all the processes known to the kernel.
.PP
The POSIX.1e capabilities are displayed in double quotes in the
.BR cap_from_text (3)
format. The IAB tuple of capabilities is displayed between square
brackets in the text format described in
.BR cap_iab (3).
Note, the IAB tuple text is omitted if it contains empty A and B
components. This is because the regular POSIX.1e text contains
information about the Inheritable flag already. This behavior can be
overridden with the
.B --verbose
command line argument.
.PP
Optional arguments (which must precede the list of pid|glob-name
values):
.TP
.B \-\-help
Displays usage information and exits. Note, modern Go runtimes exit
with status 0 in this case, but older runtimes exit with status 2.
.TP
.BR \-\-verbose
Displays capability sets and IAB tuples even when they are empty, or
redundant.
.TP
.BI \-\-depth =n
Displays the process tree to a depth of
.IR n .
Note, the default value for this parameter is 0, which implies
infinite depth.
.TP
.BI \-\-colo[u]r =false
Colo[u]rs the targeted PIDs, if stdout is a TTY, in red. This option
defaults to true when running via a TTY. The \fB--color\fI=false\fR
argument will suppress this color. Piping the output into some other
program will also suppress the use of colo[u]r.
.SH EXIT STATUS
If the supplied target cannot be found the exit status is 1. Should an
unrecognized option be provided, the exit status is 2. Otherwise,
.B captree
exits with status 0.
