1 Introduction
**************

BFD is a package which allows applications to use the same routines to
operate on object files whatever the object file format.  A new object
file format can be supported simply by creating a new BFD back end and
adding it to the library.

   BFD is split into two parts: the front end, and the back ends (one
for each object file format).
   * The front end of BFD provides the interface to the user.  It
     manages memory and various canonical data structures.  The front
     end also decides which back end to use and when to call back end
     routines.
   * The back ends provide BFD its view of the real world.  Each back
     end provides a set of calls which the BFD front end can use to
     maintain its canonical form.  The back ends also may keep around
     information for their own use, for greater efficiency.

1.1 History
===========

One spur behind BFD was the desire, on the part of the GNU 960 team at
Intel Oregon, for interoperability of applications on their COFF and
b.out file formats.  Cygnus was providing GNU support for the team, and
was contracted to provide the required functionality.

   The name came from a conversation David Wallace was having with
Richard Stallman about the library: RMS said that it would be quite
hard--David said "BFD". Stallman was right, but the name stuck.

   At the same time, Ready Systems wanted much the same thing, but for
different object file formats: IEEE-695, Oasys, Srecords, a.out and 68k
coff.

   BFD was first implemented by members of Cygnus Support; Steve
Chamberlain ('sac@cygnus.com'), John Gilmore ('gnu@cygnus.com'), K.
Richard Pixley ('rich@cygnus.com') and David Henkel-Wallace
('gumby@cygnus.com').

1.2 How To Use BFD
==================

To use the library, include 'bfd.h' and link with 'libbfd.a'.

   BFD provides a common interface to the parts of an object file for a
calling application.

   When an application successfully opens a target file (object,
archive, or whatever), a pointer to an internal structure is returned.
This pointer points to a structure called 'bfd', described in 'bfd.h'.
Our convention is to call this pointer a BFD, and instances of it within
code 'abfd'.  All operations on the target object file are applied as
methods to the BFD. The mapping is defined within 'bfd.h' in a set of
macros, all beginning with 'bfd_' to reduce namespace pollution.

   For example, this sequence does what you would probably expect:
return the number of sections in an object file attached to a BFD
'abfd'.

     #include "bfd.h"

     unsigned int number_of_sections (abfd)
     bfd *abfd;
     {
       return bfd_count_sections (abfd);
     }

   The abstraction used within BFD is that an object file has:

   * a header,
   * a number of sections containing raw data (*note Sections::),
   * a set of relocations (*note Relocations::), and
   * some symbol information (*note Symbols::).
Also, BFDs opened for archives have the additional attribute of an index
and contain subordinate BFDs.  This approach is fine for a.out and coff,
but loses efficiency when applied to formats such as S-records and
IEEE-695.

1.3 What BFD Version 2 Can Do
=============================

When an object file is opened, BFD subroutines automatically determine
the format of the input object file.  They then build a descriptor in
memory with pointers to routines that will be used to access elements of
the object file's data structures.

   As different information from the object files is required, BFD reads
from different sections of the file and processes them.  For example, a
very common operation for the linker is processing symbol tables.  Each
BFD back end provides a routine for converting between the object file's
representation of symbols and an internal canonical format.  When the
linker asks for the symbol table of an object file, it calls through a
memory pointer to the routine from the relevant BFD back end which reads
and converts the table into a canonical form.  The linker then operates
upon the canonical form.  When the link is finished and the linker
writes the output file's symbol table, another BFD back end routine is
called to take the newly created symbol table and convert it into the
chosen output format.

File: bfd.info,  Node: BFD information loss,  Next: Canonical format,  Up: What BFD Version 2 Can Do

1.3.1 Information Loss
----------------------

_Information can be lost during output._  The output formats supported
by BFD do not provide identical facilities, and information which can be
described in one form has nowhere to go in another format.  One example
of this is alignment information in 'b.out'.  There is nowhere in an
'a.out' format file to store alignment information on the contained
data, so when a file is linked from 'b.out' and an 'a.out' image is
produced, alignment information will not propagate to the output file.
(The linker will still use the alignment information internally, so the
link is performed correctly).

   Another example is COFF section names.  COFF files may contain an
unlimited number of sections, each one with a textual section name.  If
the target of the link is a format which does not have many sections
(e.g., 'a.out') or has sections without names (e.g., the Oasys format),
the link cannot be done simply.  You can circumvent this problem by
describing the desired input-to-output section mapping with the linker
command language.

   _Information can be lost during canonicalization._  The BFD internal
canonical form of the external formats is not exhaustive; there are
structures in input formats for which there is no direct representation
internally.  This means that the BFD back ends cannot maintain all
possible data richness through the transformation between external to
internal and back to external formats.

   This limitation is only a problem when an application reads one
format and writes another.  Each BFD back end is responsible for
maintaining as much data as possible, and the internal BFD canonical
form has structures which are opaque to the BFD core, and exported only
to the back ends.  When a file is read in one format, the canonical form
is generated for BFD and the application.  At the same time, the back
end saves away any information which may otherwise be lost.  If the data
is then written back in the same format, the back end routine will be
able to use the canonical form provided by the BFD core as well as the
information it prepared earlier.  Since there is a great deal of
commonality between back ends, there is no information lost when linking
or copying big endian COFF to little endian COFF, or 'a.out' to 'b.out'.
When a mixture of formats is linked, the information is only lost from
the files whose format differs from the destination.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Canonical format,  Prev: BFD information loss,  Up: What BFD Version 2 Can Do

1.3.2 The BFD canonical object-file format
------------------------------------------

The greatest potential for loss of information occurs when there is the
least overlap between the information provided by the source format,
that stored by the canonical format, and that needed by the destination
format.  A brief description of the canonical form may help you
understand which kinds of data you can count on preserving across
conversions.

_files_
     Information stored on a per-file basis includes target machine
     architecture, particular implementation format type, a demand
     pageable bit, and a write protected bit.  Information like Unix
     magic numbers is not stored here--only the magic numbers' meaning,
     so a 'ZMAGIC' file would have both the demand pageable bit and the
     write protected text bit set.  The byte order of the target is
     stored on a per-file basis, so that big- and little-endian object
     files may be used with one another.

_sections_
     Each section in the input file contains the name of the section,
     the section's original address in the object file, size and
     alignment information, various flags, and pointers into other BFD
     data structures.

_symbols_
     Each symbol contains a pointer to the information for the object
     file which originally defined it, its name, its value, and various
     flag bits.  When a BFD back end reads in a symbol table, it
     relocates all symbols to make them relative to the base of the
     section where they were defined.  Doing this ensures that each
     symbol points to its containing section.  Each symbol also has a
     varying amount of hidden private data for the BFD back end.  Since
     the symbol points to the original file, the private data format for
     that symbol is accessible.  'ld' can operate on a collection of
     symbols of wildly different formats without problems.

     Normal global and simple local symbols are maintained on output, so
     an output file (no matter its format) will retain symbols pointing
     to functions and to global, static, and common variables.  Some
     symbol information is not worth retaining; in 'a.out', type
     information is stored in the symbol table as long symbol names.
     This information would be useless to most COFF debuggers; the
     linker has command-line switches to allow users to throw it away.

     There is one word of type information within the symbol, so if the
     format supports symbol type information within symbols (for
     example, COFF, Oasys) and the type is simple enough to fit within
     one word (nearly everything but aggregates), the information will
     be preserved.

_relocation level_
     Each canonical BFD relocation record contains a pointer to the
     symbol to relocate to, the offset of the data to relocate, the
     section the data is in, and a pointer to a relocation type
     descriptor.  Relocation is performed by passing messages through
     the relocation type descriptor and the symbol pointer.  Therefore,
     relocations can be performed on output data using a relocation
     method that is only available in one of the input formats.  For
     instance, Oasys provides a byte relocation format.  A relocation
     record requesting this relocation type would point indirectly to a
     routine to perform this, so the relocation may be performed on a
     byte being written to a 68k COFF file, even though 68k COFF has no
     such relocation type.

_line numbers_
     Object formats can contain, for debugging purposes, some form of
     mapping between symbols, source line numbers, and addresses in the
     output file.  These addresses have to be relocated along with the
     symbol information.  Each symbol with an associated list of line
     number records points to the first record of the list.  The head of
     a line number list consists of a pointer to the symbol, which
     allows finding out the address of the function whose line number is
     being described.  The rest of the list is made up of pairs: offsets
     into the section and line numbers.  Any format which can simply
     derive this information can pass it successfully between formats.

2.2 Error reporting
===================

Most BFD functions return nonzero on success (check their individual
documentation for precise semantics).  On an error, they call
'bfd_set_error' to set an error condition that callers can check by
calling 'bfd_get_error'.  If that returns 'bfd_error_system_call', then
check 'errno'.

   The easiest way to report a BFD error to the user is to use
'bfd_perror'.

2.2.1 Type 'bfd_error_type'
---------------------------

The values returned by 'bfd_get_error' are defined by the enumerated
type 'bfd_error_type'.


     typedef enum bfd_error
     {
       bfd_error_no_error = 0,
       bfd_error_system_call,
       bfd_error_invalid_target,
       bfd_error_wrong_format,
       bfd_error_wrong_object_format,
       bfd_error_invalid_operation,
       bfd_error_no_memory,
       bfd_error_no_symbols,
       bfd_error_no_armap,
       bfd_error_no_more_archived_files,
       bfd_error_malformed_archive,
       bfd_error_missing_dso,
       bfd_error_file_not_recognized,
       bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized,
       bfd_error_no_contents,
       bfd_error_nonrepresentable_section,
       bfd_error_no_debug_section,
       bfd_error_bad_value,
       bfd_error_file_truncated,
       bfd_error_file_too_big,
       bfd_error_sorry,
       bfd_error_on_input,
       bfd_error_invalid_error_code
     }
     bfd_error_type;

2.2.1.1 'bfd_get_error'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_type bfd_get_error (void);
   *Description*
Return the current BFD error condition.

2.2.1.2 'bfd_set_error'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_error (bfd_error_type error_tag);
   *Description*
Set the BFD error condition to be ERROR_TAG.

   ERROR_TAG must not be bfd_error_on_input.  Use bfd_set_input_error
for input errors instead.

2.2.1.3 'bfd_set_input_error'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_input_error (bfd *input, bfd_error_type error_tag);
   *Description*
Set the BFD error condition to be bfd_error_on_input.  INPUT is the
input bfd where the error occurred, and ERROR_TAG the bfd_error_type
error.

2.2.1.4 'bfd_errmsg'
....................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_errmsg (bfd_error_type error_tag);
   *Description*
Return a string describing the error ERROR_TAG, or the system error if
ERROR_TAG is 'bfd_error_system_call'.

2.2.1.5 'bfd_perror'
....................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_perror (const char *message);
   *Description*
Print to the standard error stream a string describing the last BFD
error that occurred, or the last system error if the last BFD error was
a system call failure.  If MESSAGE is non-NULL and non-empty, the error
string printed is preceded by MESSAGE, a colon, and a space.  It is
followed by a newline.

2.2.2 BFD error handler
-----------------------

Some BFD functions want to print messages describing the problem.  They
call a BFD error handler function.  This function may be overridden by
the program.

   The BFD error handler acts like vprintf.


     typedef void (*bfd_error_handler_type) (const char *, va_list);

2.2.2.1 '_bfd_error_handler'
............................

*Synopsis*
     void _bfd_error_handler (const char *fmt, ...) ATTRIBUTE_PRINTF_1;
   *Description*
This is the default routine to handle BFD error messages.  Like fprintf
(stderr, ...), but also handles some extra format specifiers.

   %pA section name from section.  For group components, prints group
name too.  %pB file name from bfd.  For archive components, prints
archive too.

   Beware: Only supports a maximum of 9 format arguments.

2.2.2.2 'bfd_set_error_handler'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_handler_type bfd_set_error_handler (bfd_error_handler_type);
   *Description*
Set the BFD error handler function.  Returns the previous function.

2.2.2.3 '_bfd_set_error_handler_caching'
........................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_error_handler_type _bfd_set_error_handler_caching (bfd *);
   *Description*
Set the BFD error handler function to one that stores messages to the
per_xvec_warn array.  Returns the previous function.

2.2.2.4 'bfd_set_error_program_name'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_error_program_name (const char *);
   *Description*
Set the program name to use when printing a BFD error.  This is printed
before the error message followed by a colon and space.  The string must
not be changed after it is passed to this function.

2.2.2.5 '_bfd_get_error_program_name'
.....................................

*Synopsis*
     const char *_bfd_get_error_program_name (void);
   *Description*
Get the program name used when printing a BFD error.

2.2.3 BFD assert handler
------------------------

If BFD finds an internal inconsistency, the bfd assert handler is called
with information on the BFD version, BFD source file and line.  If this
happens, most programs linked against BFD are expected to want to exit
with an error, or mark the current BFD operation as failed, so it is
recommended to override the default handler, which just calls
_bfd_error_handler and continues.


     typedef void (*bfd_assert_handler_type) (const char *bfd_formatmsg,
                                              const char *bfd_version,
                                              const char *bfd_file,
                                              int bfd_line);

2.2.3.1 'bfd_set_assert_handler'
................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_assert_handler_type bfd_set_assert_handler (bfd_assert_handler_type);
   *Description*
Set the BFD assert handler function.  Returns the previous function.

2.3 Miscellaneous
=================

2.3.1 Miscellaneous functions
-----------------------------

2.3.1.1 'bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound (bfd *abfd, asection *sect);
   *Description*
Return the number of bytes required to store the relocation information
associated with section SECT attached to bfd ABFD.  If an error occurs,
return -1.

2.3.1.2 'bfd_canonicalize_reloc'
................................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_canonicalize_reloc
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, arelent **loc, asymbol **syms);
   *Description*
Call the back end associated with the open BFD ABFD and translate the
external form of the relocation information attached to SEC into the
internal canonical form.  Place the table into memory at LOC, which has
been preallocated, usually by a call to 'bfd_get_reloc_upper_bound'.
Returns the number of relocs, or -1 on error.

   The SYMS table is also needed for horrible internal magic reasons.

2.3.1.3 'bfd_set_reloc'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_reloc
        (bfd *abfd, asection *sec, arelent **rel, unsigned int count);
   *Description*
Set the relocation pointer and count within section SEC to the values
REL and COUNT.  The argument ABFD is ignored.
     #define bfd_set_reloc(abfd, asect, location, count) \
            BFD_SEND (abfd, _bfd_set_reloc, (abfd, asect, location, count))

2.3.1.4 'bfd_set_file_flags'
............................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_set_file_flags (bfd *abfd, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Set the flag word in the BFD ABFD to the value FLAGS.

   Possible errors are:

   * 'bfd_error_wrong_format' - The target bfd was not of object format.
   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The target bfd was open for
     reading.
   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The flag word contained a bit which
     was not applicable to the type of file.  E.g., an attempt was made
     to set the 'D_PAGED' bit on a BFD format which does not support
     demand paging.

2.3.1.5 'bfd_get_arch_size'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_get_arch_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Returns the normalized architecture address size, in bits, as determined
by the object file's format.  By normalized, we mean either 32 or 64.
For ELF, this information is included in the header.  Use
bfd_arch_bits_per_address for number of bits in the architecture
address.

   *Returns*
Returns the arch size in bits if known, '-1' otherwise.

2.3.1.6 'bfd_get_sign_extend_vma'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_get_sign_extend_vma (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Indicates if the target architecture "naturally" sign extends an
address.  Some architectures implicitly sign extend address values when
they are converted to types larger than the size of an address.  For
instance, bfd_get_start_address() will return an address sign extended
to fill a bfd_vma when this is the case.

   *Returns*
Returns '1' if the target architecture is known to sign extend
addresses, '0' if the target architecture is known to not sign extend
addresses, and '-1' otherwise.

2.3.1.7 'bfd_set_start_address'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_set_start_address (bfd *abfd, bfd_vma vma);
   *Description*
Make VMA the entry point of output BFD ABFD.

   *Returns*
Returns 'TRUE' on success, 'FALSE' otherwise.

2.3.1.8 'bfd_get_gp_size'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     unsigned int bfd_get_gp_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register
under MIPS ECOFF. This is typically set by the '-G' argument to the
compiler, assembler or linker.

2.3.1.9 'bfd_set_gp_size'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_gp_size (bfd *abfd, unsigned int i);
   *Description*
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register
under ECOFF or MIPS ELF. This is typically set by the '-G' argument to
the compiler, assembler or linker.

2.3.1.10 'bfd_set_gp_value'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_set_gp_value (bfd *abfd, bfd_vma v);
   *Description*
Allow external access to the fucntion to set the GP value.  This is
specifically added for gdb-compile support.

2.3.1.11 'bfd_scan_vma'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_vma bfd_scan_vma (const char *string, const char **end, int base);
   *Description*
Convert, like 'strtoul', a numerical expression STRING into a 'bfd_vma'
integer, and return that integer.  (Though without as many bells and
whistles as 'strtoul'.)  The expression is assumed to be unsigned (i.e.,
positive).  If given a BASE, it is used as the base for conversion.  A
base of 0 causes the function to interpret the string in hex if a
leading "0x" or "0X" is found, otherwise in octal if a leading zero is
found, otherwise in decimal.

   If the value would overflow, the maximum 'bfd_vma' value is returned.

The 'struct bfd_iovec' contains the internal file I/O class.  Each 'BFD'
has an instance of this class and all file I/O is routed through it (it
is assumed that the instance implements all methods listed below).
     struct bfd_iovec
     {
       /* To avoid problems with macros, a "b" rather than "f"
          prefix is prepended to each method name.  */

          bytes starting at PTR.  Return the number of bytes actually
          transfered (a read past end-of-file returns less than NBYTES),
          or -1 (setting bfd_error) if an error occurs.  */

          if an error occurs.  */
       file_ptr (*btell) (struct bfd *abfd);
       /* For the following, on successful completion a value of 0 is returned.

          Also write in MAP_ADDR the address of the page aligned buffer and in
          MAP_LEN the size mapped (a page multiple).  Use unmap with MAP_ADDR and
          MAP_LEN to unmap.  */

2.3.1.21 'bfd_get_mtime'
........................

*Synopsis*
     long bfd_get_mtime (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the file modification time (as read from the file system, or from
the archive header for archive members).

2.3.1.22 'bfd_get_size'
.......................

*Synopsis*
     ufile_ptr bfd_get_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the file size (as read from file system) for the file associated
with BFD ABFD.

   The initial motivation for, and use of, this routine is not so we can
get the exact size of the object the BFD applies to, since that might
not be generally possible (archive members for example).  It would be
ideal if someone could eventually modify it so that such results were
guaranteed.

   Instead, we want to ask questions like "is this NNN byte sized object
I'm about to try read from file offset YYY reasonable?"  As as example
of where we might do this, some object formats use string tables for
which the first 'sizeof (long)' bytes of the table contain the size of
the table itself, including the size bytes.  If an application tries to
read what it thinks is one of these string tables, without some way to
validate the size, and for some reason the size is wrong (byte swapping
error, wrong location for the string table, etc.), the only clue is
likely to be a read error when it tries to read the table, or a "virtual
memory exhausted" error when it tries to allocate 15 bazillon bytes of
space for the 15 bazillon byte table it is about to read.  This function
at least allows us to answer the question, "is the size reasonable?".

   A return value of zero indicates the file size is unknown.

2.3.1.23 'bfd_get_file_size'
............................

*Synopsis*
     ufile_ptr bfd_get_file_size (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return the file size (as read from file system) for the file associated
with BFD ABFD.  It supports both normal files and archive elements.

2.3.1.24 'bfd_mmap'
...................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_mmap (bfd *abfd, void *addr, bfd_size_type len,
         int prot, int flags, file_ptr offset,
         void **map_addr, bfd_size_type *map_len);
   *Description*
Return mmap()ed region of the file, if possible and implemented.  LEN
and OFFSET do not need to be page aligned.  The page aligned address and
length are written to MAP_ADDR and MAP_LEN.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Memory Usage,  Next: Initialization,  Prev: Miscellaneous,  Up: BFD front end

2.4 Memory Usage
================

BFD keeps all of its internal structures in obstacks.  There is one
obstack per open BFD file, into which the current state is stored.  When
a BFD is closed, the obstack is deleted, and so everything which has
been allocated by BFD for the closing file is thrown away.

   BFD does not free anything created by an application, but pointers
into 'bfd' structures become invalid on a 'bfd_close'; for example,
after a 'bfd_close' the vector passed to 'bfd_canonicalize_symtab' is
still around, since it has been allocated by the application, but the
data that it pointed to are lost.

   The general rule is to not close a BFD until all operations dependent
upon data from the BFD have been completed, or all the data from within
the file has been copied.  To help with the management of memory, there
is a function ('bfd_alloc_size') which returns the number of bytes in
obstacks associated with the supplied BFD. This could be used to select
the greediest open BFD, close it to reclaim the memory, perform some
operation and reopen the BFD again, to get a fresh copy of the data
structures.

2.5 Initialization
==================

2.5.1 Initialization functions
------------------------------

These are the functions that handle initializing a BFD.

2.5.1.1 'bfd_init'
..................

*Synopsis*
     unsigned int bfd_init (void);
   *Description*
This routine must be called before any other BFD function to initialize
magical internal data structures.  Returns a magic number, which may be
used to check that the bfd library is configured as expected by users.

     /* Value returned by bfd_init.  */

     #define BFD_INIT_MAGIC (sizeof (struct bfd_section))


File: bfd.info,  Node: Sections,  Next: Symbols,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: BFD front end

2.6 Sections
============

The raw data contained within a BFD is maintained through the section
abstraction.  A single BFD may have any number of sections.  It keeps
hold of them by pointing to the first; each one points to the next in
the list.

   Sections are supported in BFD in 'section.c'.

* Menu:

* Section Input::
* Section Output::
* typedef asection::
* section prototypes::


File: bfd.info,  Node: Section Input,  Next: Section Output,  Prev: Sections,  Up: Sections

2.6.1 Section input
-------------------

When a BFD is opened for reading, the section structures are created and
attached to the BFD.

   Each section has a name which describes the section in the outside
world--for example, 'a.out' would contain at least three sections,
called '.text', '.data' and '.bss'.

   Names need not be unique; for example a COFF file may have several
sections named '.data'.

   Sometimes a BFD will contain more than the "natural" number of
sections.  A back end may attach other sections containing constructor
data, or an application may add a section (using 'bfd_make_section') to
the sections attached to an already open BFD. For example, the linker
creates an extra section 'COMMON' for each input file's BFD to hold
information about common storage.

   The raw data is not necessarily read in when the section descriptor
is created.  Some targets may leave the data in place until a
'bfd_get_section_contents' call is made.  Other back ends may read in
all the data at once.  For example, an S-record file has to be read once
to determine the size of the data.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Section Output,  Next: typedef asection,  Prev: Section Input,  Up: Sections

2.6.2 Section output
--------------------

To write a new object style BFD, the various sections to be written have
to be created.  They are attached to the BFD in the same way as input
sections; data is written to the sections using
'bfd_set_section_contents'.

   Any program that creates or combines sections (e.g., the assembler
and linker) must use the 'asection' fields 'output_section' and
'output_offset' to indicate the file sections to which each section must
be written.  (If the section is being created from scratch,
'output_section' should probably point to the section itself and
'output_offset' should probably be zero.)

   The data to be written comes from input sections attached (via
'output_section' pointers) to the output sections.  The output section
structure can be considered a filter for the input section: the output
section determines the vma of the output data and the name, but the
input section determines the offset into the output section of the data
to be written.

   E.g., to create a section "O", starting at 0x100, 0x123 long,
containing two subsections, "A" at offset 0x0 (i.e., at vma 0x100) and
"B" at offset 0x20 (i.e., at vma 0x120) the 'asection' structures would
look like:

        section name          "A"
          output_offset   0x00
          size            0x20
          output_section ----------->  section name    "O"
                                  |    vma             0x100
        section name          "B" |    size            0x123
          output_offset   0x20    |
          size            0x103   |
          output_section  --------|

2.6.3 Link orders
-----------------

The data within a section is stored in a "link_order".  These are much
like the fixups in 'gas'.  The link_order abstraction allows a section
to grow and shrink within itself.

   A link_order knows how big it is, and which is the next link_order
and where the raw data for it is; it also points to a list of
relocations which apply to it.

   The link_order is used by the linker to perform relaxing on final
code.  The compiler creates code which is as big as necessary to make it
work without relaxing, and the user can select whether to relax.
Sometimes relaxing takes a lot of time.  The linker runs around the
relocations to see if any are attached to data which can be shrunk, if
so it does it on a link_order by link_order basis.

2.6.5.7 'bfd_make_section_old_way'
..................................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section_old_way (bfd *abfd, const char *name);
   *Description*
Create a new empty section called NAME and attach it to the end of the
chain of sections for the BFD ABFD.  An attempt to create a section with
a name which is already in use returns its pointer without changing the
section chain.

   It has the funny name since this is the way it used to be before it
was rewritten....

   Possible errors are:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - If output has already started for
     this BFD.
   * 'bfd_error_no_memory' - If memory allocation fails.

2.6.5.8 'bfd_make_section_anyway_with_flags'

        (bfd *abfd, const char *name, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Create a new empty section called NAME and attach it to the end of the
chain of sections for ABFD.  Create a new section even if there is
already a section with that name.  Also set the attributes of the new
section to the value FLAGS.

   Return 'NULL' and set 'bfd_error' on error; possible errors are:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - If output has already started for
     ABFD.
   * 'bfd_error_no_memory' - If memory allocation fails.

2.6.5.9 'bfd_make_section_anyway'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section_anyway (bfd *abfd, const char *name);
   *Description*
Create a new empty section called NAME and attach it to the end of the
chain of sections for ABFD.  Create a new section even if there is
already a section with that name.

   Return 'NULL' and set 'bfd_error' on error; possible errors are:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - If output has already started for
     ABFD.
   * 'bfd_error_no_memory' - If memory allocation fails.

2.6.5.10 'bfd_make_section_with_flags'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section_with_flags
        (bfd *, const char *name, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Like 'bfd_make_section_anyway', but return 'NULL' (without calling
bfd_set_error ()) without changing the section chain if there is already
a section named NAME.  Also set the attributes of the new section to the
value FLAGS.  If there is an error, return 'NULL' and set 'bfd_error'.

2.6.5.11 'bfd_make_section'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_make_section (bfd *, const char *name);
   *Description*
Like 'bfd_make_section_anyway', but return 'NULL' (without calling
bfd_set_error ()) without changing the section chain if there is already
a section named NAME.  If there is an error, return 'NULL' and set
'bfd_error'.

2.6.5.12 'bfd_set_section_flags'
................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_set_section_flags (asection *sec, flagword flags);
   *Description*
Set the attributes of the section SEC to the value FLAGS.  Return 'TRUE'
on success, 'FALSE' on error.  Possible error returns are:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The section cannot have one or more
     of the attributes requested.  For example, a .bss section in
     'a.out' may not have the 'SEC_HAS_CONTENTS' field set.

2.6.5.13 'bfd_rename_section'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_rename_section
        (asection *sec, const char *newname);

2.6.5.14 'bfd_map_over_sections'
................................

*Synopsis*
     void bfd_map_over_sections
        (bfd *abfd,
         void (*func) (bfd *abfd, asection *sect, void *obj),
         void *obj);
   *Description*
Call the provided function FUNC for each section attached to the BFD
ABFD, passing OBJ as an argument.  The function will be called as if by

            func (abfd, the_section, obj);

   This is the preferred method for iterating over sections; an
alternative would be to use a loop:

               asection *p;
               for (p = abfd->sections; p != NULL; p = p->next)
                  func (abfd, p, ...)

2.6.5.15 'bfd_sections_find_if'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     asection *bfd_sections_find_if

         void *obj);
   *Description*
Call the provided function OPERATION for each section attached to the
BFD ABFD, passing OBJ as an argument.  The function will be called as if
by

            operation (abfd, the_section, obj);

   It returns the first section for which OPERATION returns true.

2.6.5.16 'bfd_set_section_size'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_set_section_size (asection *sec, bfd_size_type val);
   *Description*
Set SEC to the size VAL.  If the operation is ok, then 'TRUE' is
returned, else 'FALSE'.

   Possible error returns:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - Writing has started to the BFD, so
     setting the size is invalid.

2.6.5.17 'bfd_set_section_contents'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_set_section_contents
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, const void *data,
         file_ptr offset, bfd_size_type count);
   *Description*
Sets the contents of the section SECTION in BFD ABFD to the data
starting in memory at LOCATION.  The data is written to the output
section starting at offset OFFSET for COUNT octets.

   Normally 'TRUE' is returned, but 'FALSE' is returned if there was an
error.  Possible error returns are:

   * 'bfd_error_no_contents' - The output section does not have the
     'SEC_HAS_CONTENTS' attribute, so nothing can be written to it.
   * 'bfd_error_bad_value' - The section is unable to contain all of the
     data.
   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - The BFD is not writeable.
   * and some more too.
   This routine is front end to the back end function
'_bfd_set_section_contents'.

2.6.5.18 'bfd_get_section_contents'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_get_section_contents
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, void *location, file_ptr offset,
         bfd_size_type count);
   *Description*
Read data from SECTION in BFD ABFD into memory starting at LOCATION.
The data is read at an offset of OFFSET from the start of the input
section, and is read for COUNT bytes.

   If the contents of a constructor with the 'SEC_CONSTRUCTOR' flag set
are requested or if the section does not have the 'SEC_HAS_CONTENTS'
flag set, then the LOCATION is filled with zeroes.  If no errors occur,
'TRUE' is returned, else 'FALSE'.

2.6.5.19 'bfd_malloc_and_get_section'
.....................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_malloc_and_get_section
        (bfd *abfd, asection *section, bfd_byte **buf);
   *Description*
Read all data from SECTION in BFD ABFD into a buffer, *BUF, malloc'd by
this function.

2.6.5.20 'bfd_copy_private_section_data'
........................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_copy_private_section_data
        (bfd *ibfd, asection *isec, bfd *obfd, asection *osec);
   *Description*
Copy private section information from ISEC in the BFD IBFD to the
section OSEC in the BFD OBFD.  Return 'TRUE' on success, 'FALSE' on
error.  Possible error returns are:

   * 'bfd_error_no_memory' - Not enough memory exists to create private
     data for OSEC.
     #define bfd_copy_private_section_data(ibfd, isection, obfd, osection) \
            BFD_SEND (obfd, _bfd_copy_private_section_data, \
                      (ibfd, isection, obfd, osection))

2.6.5.21 'bfd_generic_is_group_section'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_generic_is_group_section (bfd *, const asection *sec);
   *Description*
Returns TRUE if SEC is a member of a group.

2.6.5.22 'bfd_generic_group_name'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_generic_group_name (bfd *, const asection *sec);
   *Description*
Returns group name if SEC is a member of a group.

2.6.5.23 'bfd_generic_discard_group'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_generic_discard_group (bfd *abfd, asection *group);

2.7 Symbols
===========

BFD tries to maintain as much symbol information as it can when it moves
information from file to file.  BFD passes information to applications
though the 'asymbol' structure.  When the application requests the
symbol table, BFD reads the table in the native form and translates
parts of it into the internal format.  To maintain more than the
information passed to applications, some targets keep some information
"behind the scenes" in a structure only the particular back end knows
about.  For example, the coff back end keeps the original symbol table
structure as well as the canonical structure when a BFD is read in.  On
output, the coff back end can reconstruct the output symbol table so
that no information is lost, even information unique to coff which BFD
doesn't know or understand.  If a coff symbol table were read, but were
written through an a.out back end, all the coff specific information
would be lost.  The symbol table of a BFD is not necessarily read in
until a canonicalize request is made.  Then the BFD back end fills in a
table provided by the application with pointers to the canonical
information.  To output symbols, the application provides BFD with a
table of pointers to pointers to 'asymbol's.  This allows applications
like the linker to output a symbol as it was read, since the "behind the
scenes" information will be still available.

2.7.1 Reading symbols
---------------------

There are two stages to reading a symbol table from a BFD: allocating
storage, and the actual reading process.  This is an excerpt from an
application which reads the symbol table:

              long storage_needed;
              asymbol **symbol_table;
              long number_of_symbols;
              long i;

              storage_needed = bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound (abfd);

              if (storage_needed < 0)
                FAIL

              if (storage_needed == 0)
                return;

              symbol_table = xmalloc (storage_needed);
                ...
              number_of_symbols =
                 bfd_canonicalize_symtab (abfd, symbol_table);

              if (number_of_symbols < 0)
                FAIL

              for (i = 0; i < number_of_symbols; i++)
                process_symbol (symbol_table[i]);

   All storage for the symbols themselves is in an objalloc connected to
the BFD; it is freed when the BFD is closed.

2.7.2 Writing symbols
---------------------

Writing of a symbol table is automatic when a BFD open for writing is
closed.  The application attaches a vector of pointers to pointers to
symbols to the BFD being written, and fills in the symbol count.  The
close and cleanup code reads through the table provided and performs all
the necessary operations.  The BFD output code must always be provided
with an "owned" symbol: one which has come from another BFD, or one
which has been created using 'bfd_make_empty_symbol'.  Here is an
example showing the creation of a symbol table with only one element:

            #include "sysdep.h"
            #include "bfd.h"
            int main (void)
            {
              bfd *abfd;
              asymbol *ptrs[2];
              asymbol *new;

              abfd = bfd_openw ("foo","a.out-sunos-big");
              bfd_set_format (abfd, bfd_object);
              new = bfd_make_empty_symbol (abfd);
              new->name = "dummy_symbol";
              new->section = bfd_make_section_old_way (abfd, ".text");
              new->flags = BSF_GLOBAL;
              new->value = 0x12345;

              ptrs[0] = new;
              ptrs[1] = 0;

              bfd_set_symtab (abfd, ptrs, 1);
              bfd_close (abfd);
              return 0;
            }

            ./makesym
            nm foo
            00012345 A dummy_symbol

   Many formats cannot represent arbitrary symbol information; for
instance, the 'a.out' object format does not allow an arbitrary number
of sections.  A symbol pointing to a section which is not one of
'.text', '.data' or '.bss' cannot be described.

2.7.3 Mini Symbols
------------------

Mini symbols provide read-only access to the symbol table.  They use
less memory space, but require more time to access.  They can be useful
for tools like nm or objdump, which may have to handle symbol tables of
extremely large executables.

   The 'bfd_read_minisymbols' function will read the symbols into memory
in an internal form.  It will return a 'void *' pointer to a block of
memory, a symbol count, and the size of each symbol.  The pointer is
allocated using 'malloc', and should be freed by the caller when it is
no longer needed.

   The function 'bfd_minisymbol_to_symbol' will take a pointer to a
minisymbol, and a pointer to a structure returned by
'bfd_make_empty_symbol', and return a 'asymbol' structure.  The return
value may or may not be the same as the value from

          is necessary so that a back end can work out what additional
          information (invisible to the application writer) is carried
          with the symbol.

          This field is *almost* redundant, since you can use section->owner
          instead, except that some symbols point to the global sections
          bfd_{abs,com,und}_section.  This could be fixed by making

NULL pointer.  If there are no symbols in the BFD, then return 0.  If an
error occurs, return -1.
     #define bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound(abfd) \
            BFD_SEND (abfd, _bfd_get_symtab_upper_bound, (abfd))

   *Description*
Return TRUE if the given symbol SYM in the BFD ABFD is a compiler
generated local label, else return FALSE.

2.7.5.3 'bfd_is_local_label_name'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_is_local_label_name (bfd *abfd, const char *name);
   *Description*
Return TRUE if a symbol with the name NAME in the BFD ABFD is a compiler
generated local label, else return FALSE. This just checks whether the
name has the form of a local label.
     #define bfd_is_local_label_name(abfd, name) \
            BFD_SEND (abfd, _bfd_is_local_label_name, (abfd, name))

2.7.5.4 'bfd_is_target_special_symbol'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_is_target_special_symbol (bfd *abfd, asymbol *sym);
   *Description*
Return TRUE iff a symbol SYM in the BFD ABFD is something special to the
particular target represented by the BFD. Such symbols should normally
not be mentioned to the user.

.................................

*Description*
Read the symbols from the BFD ABFD, and fills in the vector LOCATION
with pointers to the symbols and a trailing NULL. Return the actual
number of symbol pointers, not including the NULL.
     #define bfd_canonicalize_symtab(abfd, location) \

...............................

*Description*
Create a new 'asymbol' structure for the BFD ABFD and return a pointer
to it.

   This routine is necessary because each back end has private
information surrounding the 'asymbol'.  Building your own 'asymbol' and
pointing to it will not create the private information, and will cause
problems later on.
     #define bfd_make_empty_symbol(abfd) \

................................

*Description*
Create a new 'asymbol' structure for the BFD ABFD, to be used as a
debugging symbol.  Further details of its use have yet to be worked out.
     #define bfd_make_debug_symbol(abfd,ptr,size) \

2.8 Archives
============

*Description*
An archive (or library) is just another BFD. It has a symbol table,
although there's not much a user program will do with it.

   The big difference between an archive BFD and an ordinary BFD is that
the archive doesn't have sections.  Instead it has a chain of BFDs that
are considered its contents.  These BFDs can be manipulated like any
other.  The BFDs contained in an archive opened for reading will all be
opened for reading.  You may put either input or output BFDs into an
archive opened for output; they will be handled correctly when the
archive is closed.

   Use 'bfd_openr_next_archived_file' to step through the contents of an
archive opened for input.  You don't have to read the entire archive if
you don't want to!  Read it until you find what you want.

   A BFD returned by 'bfd_openr_next_archived_file' can be closed
manually with 'bfd_close'.  If you do not close it, then a second
iteration through the members of an archive may return the same BFD. If
you close the archive BFD, then all the member BFDs will automatically
be closed as well.

   Archive contents of output BFDs are chained through the
'archive_next' pointer in a BFD. The first one is findable through the
'archive_head' slot of the archive.  Set it with 'bfd_set_archive_head'
(q.v.).  A given BFD may be in only one open output archive at a time.

   As expected, the BFD archive code is more general than the archive
code of any given environment.  BFD archives may contain files of
different formats (e.g., a.out and coff) and even different
architectures.  You may even place archives recursively into archives!

   This can cause unexpected confusion, since some archive formats are
more expressive than others.  For instance, Intel COFF archives can
preserve long filenames; SunOS a.out archives cannot.  If you move a
file from the first to the second format and back again, the filename
may be truncated.  Likewise, different a.out environments have different
conventions as to how they truncate filenames, whether they preserve
directory names in filenames, etc.  When interoperating with native
tools, be sure your files are homogeneous.

   Beware: most of these formats do not react well to the presence of
spaces in filenames.  We do the best we can, but can't always handle
this case due to restrictions in the format of archives.  Many Unix
utilities are braindead in regards to spaces and such in filenames
anyway, so this shouldn't be much of a restriction.

   Archives are supported in BFD in 'archive.c'.

2.8.1 Archive functions
-----------------------

2.8.1.1 'bfd_get_next_mapent'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     symindex bfd_get_next_mapent
        (bfd *abfd, symindex previous, carsym **sym);
   *Description*
Step through archive ABFD's symbol table (if it has one).  Successively
update SYM with the next symbol's information, returning that symbol's
(internal) index into the symbol table.

   Supply 'BFD_NO_MORE_SYMBOLS' as the PREVIOUS entry to get the first
one; returns 'BFD_NO_MORE_SYMBOLS' when you've already got the last one.

   A 'carsym' is a canonical archive symbol.  The only user-visible
element is its name, a null-terminated string.

2.8.1.2 'bfd_set_archive_head'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_set_archive_head (bfd *output, bfd *new_head);
   *Description*
Set the head of the chain of BFDs contained in the archive OUTPUT to
NEW_HEAD.

2.8.1.3 'bfd_openr_next_archived_file'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr_next_archived_file (bfd *archive, bfd *previous);
   *Description*
Provided a BFD, ARCHIVE, containing an archive and NULL, open an input
BFD on the first contained element and returns that.  Subsequent calls
should pass the archive and the previous return value to return a
created BFD to the next contained element.  NULL is returned when there
are no more.  Note - if you want to process the bfd returned by this
call be sure to call bfd_check_format() on it first.

2.9 File formats
================

A format is a BFD concept of high level file contents type.  The formats
supported by BFD are:

   * 'bfd_object'
   The BFD may contain data, symbols, relocations and debug info.

   * 'bfd_archive'
   The BFD contains other BFDs and an optional index.

   * 'bfd_core'
   The BFD contains the result of an executable core dump.

2.9.1 File format functions
---------------------------

2.9.1.1 'bfd_check_format'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_check_format (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);
   *Description*
Verify if the file attached to the BFD ABFD is compatible with the
format FORMAT (i.e., one of 'bfd_object', 'bfd_archive' or 'bfd_core').

   If the BFD has been set to a specific target before the call, only
the named target and format combination is checked.  If the target has
not been set, or has been set to 'default', then all the known target
backends is interrogated to determine a match.  If the default target
matches, it is used.  If not, exactly one target must recognize the
file, or an error results.

   The function returns 'TRUE' on success, otherwise 'FALSE' with one of
the following error codes:

   * 'bfd_error_invalid_operation' - if 'format' is not one of
     'bfd_object', 'bfd_archive' or 'bfd_core'.

   * 'bfd_error_system_call' - if an error occured during a read - even
     some file mismatches can cause bfd_error_system_calls.

   * 'file_not_recognised' - none of the backends recognised the file
     format.

   * 'bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized' - more than one backend
     recognised the file format.

2.9.1.2 'bfd_check_format_matches'
..................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_check_format_matches
        (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format, char ***matching);
   *Description*
Like 'bfd_check_format', except when it returns FALSE with 'bfd_errno'
set to 'bfd_error_file_ambiguously_recognized'.  In that case, if
MATCHING is not NULL, it will be filled in with a NULL-terminated list
of the names of the formats that matched, allocated with 'malloc'.  Then
the user may choose a format and try again.

   When done with the list that MATCHING points to, the caller should
free it.

2.9.1.3 'bfd_set_format'
........................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_set_format (bfd *abfd, bfd_format format);
   *Description*
This function sets the file format of the BFD ABFD to the format FORMAT.
If the target set in the BFD does not support the format requested, the
format is invalid, or the BFD is not open for writing, then an error
occurs.

2.9.1.4 'bfd_format_string'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_format_string (bfd_format format);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to a const string 'invalid', 'object', 'archive',
'core', or 'unknown', depending upon the value of FORMAT.

2.10 Relocations
================

BFD maintains relocations in much the same way it maintains symbols:
they are left alone until required, then read in en-masse and translated
into an internal form.  A common routine 'bfd_perform_relocation' acts
upon the canonical form to do the fixup.

   Relocations are maintained on a per section basis, while symbols are
maintained on a per BFD basis.

   All that a back end has to do to fit the BFD interface is to create a
'struct reloc_cache_entry' for each relocation in a particular section,
and fill in the right bits of the structures.

       /* Pointer to how to perform the required relocation.  */
       reloc_howto_type *howto;

     }
     arelent;

   *Description*
Here is a description of each of the fields within an 'arelent':

   * 'sym_ptr_ptr'
   The symbol table pointer points to a pointer to the symbol associated
with the relocation request.  It is the pointer into the table returned
by the back end's 'canonicalize_symtab' action.  *Note Symbols::.  The
symbol is referenced through a pointer to a pointer so that tools like
the linker can fix up all the symbols of the same name by modifying only
one pointer.  The relocation routine looks in the symbol and uses the
base of the section the symbol is attached to and the value of the
symbol as the initial relocation offset.  If the symbol pointer is zero,
then the section provided is looked up.

   * 'address'
   The 'address' field gives the offset in bytes from the base of the
section data which owns the relocation record to the first byte of
relocatable information.  The actual data relocated will be relative to
this point; for example, a relocation type which modifies the bottom two
bytes of a four byte word would not touch the first byte pointed to in a
big endian world.

   * 'addend'
   The 'addend' is a value provided by the back end to be added (!)  to
the relocation offset.  Its interpretation is dependent upon the howto.
For example, on the 68k the code:

             char foo[];
             main()
                     {
                     return foo[0x12345678];
                     }

   Could be compiled into:

             linkw fp,#-4
             moveb @#12345678,d0
             extbl d0
             unlk fp
             rts

   This could create a reloc pointing to 'foo', but leave the offset in
the data, something like:

     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000006 32        _foo

     00000000 4e56 fffc          ; linkw fp,#-4
     00000004 1039 1234 5678     ; moveb @#12345678,d0
     0000000a 49c0               ; extbl d0
     0000000c 4e5e               ; unlk fp
     0000000e 4e75               ; rts

   Using coff and an 88k, some instructions don't have enough space in
them to represent the full address range, and pointers have to be loaded
in two parts.  So you'd get something like:

             or.u     r13,r0,hi16(_foo+0x12345678)
             ld.b     r2,r13,lo16(_foo+0x12345678)
             jmp      r1

   This should create two relocs, both pointing to '_foo', and with
0x12340000 in their addend field.  The data would consist of:

     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000002 HVRT16    _foo+0x12340000
     00000006 LVRT16    _foo+0x12340000

     00000000 5da05678           ; or.u r13,r0,0x5678
     00000004 1c4d5678           ; ld.b r2,r13,0x5678
     00000008 f400c001           ; jmp r1

   The relocation routine digs out the value from the data, adds it to
the addend to get the original offset, and then adds the value of
'_foo'.  Note that all 32 bits have to be kept around somewhere, to cope
with carry from bit 15 to bit 16.

   One further example is the sparc and the a.out format.  The sparc has
a similar problem to the 88k, in that some instructions don't have room
for an entire offset, but on the sparc the parts are created in odd
sized lumps.  The designers of the a.out format chose to not use the
data within the section for storing part of the offset; all the offset
is kept within the reloc.  Anything in the data should be ignored.

             save %sp,-112,%sp
             sethi %hi(_foo+0x12345678),%g2
             ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0x12345678)],%i0
             ret
             restore

   Both relocs contain a pointer to 'foo', and the offsets contain junk.

     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000004 HI22      _foo+0x12345678
     00000008 LO10      _foo+0x12345678

     00000000 9de3bf90     ; save %sp,-112,%sp
     00000004 05000000     ; sethi %hi(_foo+0),%g2
     00000008 f048a000     ; ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0)],%i0
     0000000c 81c7e008     ; ret
     00000010 81e80000     ; restore

   * 'howto'
   The 'howto' field can be imagined as a relocation instruction.  It is
a pointer to a structure which contains information on what to do with
all of the other information in the reloc record and data section.  A
back end would normally have a relocation instruction set and turn
relocations into pointers to the correct structure on input - but it
would be possible to create each howto field on demand.

          addend is recorded with the section contents; when performing a
          partial link (ld -r) the section contents (the data) will be

          However, the converse is not true: not all relocations of all ELF
          USE_REL targets set this field to TRUE.  Why this is so is peculiar
          to each particular target.  For relocs that aren't used in partial

2.10.1.3 'The HOWTO Macro'
..........................

*Description*
The HOWTO macro fills in a reloc_howto_type (a typedef for const struct
reloc_howto_struct).
     #define HOWTO_RSIZE(sz) ((sz) < 0 ? -(sz) : (sz))
     #define HOWTO(type, right, size, bits, pcrel, left, ovf, func, name,   \
                   inplace, src_mask, dst_mask, pcrel_off)                  \
       { (unsigned) type, HOWTO_RSIZE (size), bits, right, left, ovf,       \
         size < 0, pcrel, inplace, pcrel_off, src_mask, dst_mask, func, name }

   *Description*
This is used to fill in an empty howto entry in an array.
     #define EMPTY_HOWTO(C) \
       HOWTO ((C), 0, 1, 0, false, 0, complain_overflow_dont, NULL, \
              NULL, false, 0, 0, false)

       return howto->size;
     }

2.10.1.4 'arelent_chain'
........................

*Description*
How relocs are tied together in an 'asection':
     typedef struct relent_chain
     {
       arelent relent;
       struct relent_chain *next;
     }
     arelent_chain;

2.10.1.5 'bfd_check_overflow'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_reloc_status_type bfd_check_overflow
        (enum complain_overflow how,
         unsigned int bitsize,
         unsigned int rightshift,
         unsigned int addrsize,
         bfd_vma relocation);
   *Description*
Perform overflow checking on RELOCATION which has BITSIZE significant
bits and will be shifted right by RIGHTSHIFT bits, on a machine with
addresses containing ADDRSIZE significant bits.  The result is either of
'bfd_reloc_ok' or 'bfd_reloc_overflow'.

2.10.1.6 'bfd_reloc_offset_in_range'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_reloc_offset_in_range
        (reloc_howto_type *howto,
         bfd *abfd,
         asection *section,
         bfd_size_type offset);
   *Description*
Returns TRUE if the reloc described by HOWTO can be applied at OFFSET
octets in SECTION.

2.10.1.7 'bfd_perform_relocation'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_reloc_status_type bfd_perform_relocation
        (bfd *abfd,
         arelent *reloc_entry,
         void *data,
         asection *input_section,
         bfd *output_bfd,
         char **error_message);
   *Description*
If OUTPUT_BFD is supplied to this function, the generated image will be
relocatable; the relocations are copied to the output file after they
have been changed to reflect the new state of the world.  There are two
ways of reflecting the results of partial linkage in an output file: by
modifying the output data in place, and by modifying the relocation
record.  Some native formats (e.g., basic a.out and basic coff) have no
way of specifying an addend in the relocation type, so the addend has to
go in the output data.  This is no big deal since in these formats the
output data slot will always be big enough for the addend.  Complex
reloc types with addends were invented to solve just this problem.  The
ERROR_MESSAGE argument is set to an error message if this return
'bfd_reloc_dangerous'.

2.10.1.8 'bfd_install_relocation'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bfd_reloc_status_type bfd_install_relocation
        (bfd *abfd,
         arelent *reloc_entry,
         void *data, bfd_vma data_start,
         asection *input_section,
         char **error_message);
   *Description*
This looks remarkably like 'bfd_perform_relocation', except it does not
expect that the section contents have been filled in.  I.e., it's
suitable for use when creating, rather than applying a relocation.

   For now, this function should be considered reserved for the
assembler.

2.10.2 The howto manager
------------------------

When an application wants to create a relocation, but doesn't know what
the target machine might call it, it can find out by using this bit of
code.

2.10.2.1 'bfd_reloc_code_type'
..............................

*Description*
The insides of a reloc code.  The idea is that, eventually, there will
be one enumerator for every type of relocation we ever do.  Pass one of
these values to 'bfd_reloc_type_lookup', and it'll return a howto
pointer.

   This does mean that the application must determine the correct
enumerator value; you can't get a howto pointer from a random set of
attributes.

   Here are the possible values for 'enum bfd_reloc_code_real':

 -- : BFD_RELOC_64
 -- : BFD_RELOC_32
 -- : BFD_RELOC_26
 -- : BFD_RELOC_24
 -- : BFD_RELOC_16
 -- : BFD_RELOC_14

 -- : BFD_RELOC_24_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_12_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_8_PCREL
     PC-relative relocations.  Sometimes these are relative to the
     address of the relocation itself; sometimes they are relative to
     the start of the section containing the relocation.  It depends on
     the specific target.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_32_SECREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_16_SECIDX
     Section relative relocations.  Some targets need this for DWARF2.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_32_GOT_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_16_GOT_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_8_GOT_PCREL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_32_GOTOFF

     Linkage-table relative.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_16_PCREL_S2
 -- : BFD_RELOC_23_PCREL_S2
     These PC-relative relocations are stored as word displacements -
     i.e., byte displacements shifted right two bits.  The 30-bit word
     displacement (<<32_PCREL_S2>> - 32 bits, shifted 2) is used on the
     SPARC. (SPARC tools generally refer to this as <<WDISP30>>.)  The
     signed 16-bit displacement is used on the MIPS, and the 23-bit
     displacement is used on the Alpha.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_HI22
 -- : BFD_RELOC_LO10
     High 22 bits and low 10 bits of 32-bit value, placed into lower
     bits of the target word.  These are used on the SPARC.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_GPREL16
 -- : BFD_RELOC_GPREL32
     For systems that allocate a Global Pointer register, these are
     displacements off that register.  These relocation types are
     handled specially, because the value the register will have is
     decided relatively late.

     SPU Relocations.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_HI16
     Alpha ECOFF and ELF relocations.  Some of these treat the symbol or
     "addend" in some special way.  For GPDISP_HI16 ("gpdisp")
     relocations, the symbol is ignored when writing; when reading, it
     will be the absolute section symbol.  The addend is the
     displacement in bytes of the "lda" instruction from the "ldah"
     instruction (which is at the address of this reloc).
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP_LO16
     For GPDISP_LO16 ("ignore") relocations, the symbol is handled as
     with GPDISP_HI16 relocs.  The addend is ignored when writing the
     relocations out, and is filled in with the file's GP value on
     reading, for convenience.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPDISP
     The ELF GPDISP relocation is exactly the same as the GPDISP_HI16
     relocation except that there is no accompanying GPDISP_LO16
     relocation.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITERAL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_ELF_LITERAL
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LITUSE
     The Alpha LITERAL/LITUSE relocs are produced by a symbol reference;
     the assembler turns it into a LDQ instruction to load the address
     of the symbol, and then fills in a register in the real
     instruction.

     The LITERAL reloc, at the LDQ instruction, refers to the .lita
     section symbol.  The addend is ignored when writing, but is filled
     in with the file's GP value on reading, for convenience, as with
     the GPDISP_LO16 reloc.

     The ELF_LITERAL reloc is somewhere between 16_GOTOFF and
     GPDISP_LO16.  It should refer to the symbol to be referenced, as
     with 16_GOTOFF, but it generates output not based on the position
     within the .got section, but relative to the GP value chosen for
     the file during the final link stage.

     The LITUSE reloc, on the instruction using the loaded address,
     gives information to the linker that it might be able to use to
     optimize away some literal section references.  The symbol is
     ignored (read as the absolute section symbol), and the "addend"
     indicates the type of instruction using the register: 1 - "memory"
     fmt insn 2 - byte-manipulation (byte offset reg) 3 - jsr (target of
     branch)
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_HINT
     The HINT relocation indicates a value that should be filled into
     the "hint" field of a jmp/jsr/ret instruction, for possible branch-
     prediction logic which may be provided on some processors.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LINKAGE
     The LINKAGE relocation outputs a linkage pair in the object file,
     which is filled by the linker.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_CODEADDR
     The CODEADDR relocation outputs a STO_CA in the object file, which
     is filled by the linker.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPREL_HI16
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_GPREL_LO16
     The GPREL_HI/LO relocations together form a 32-bit offset from the
     GP register.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BRSGP
     Like BFD_RELOC_23_PCREL_S2, except that the source and target must
     share a common GP, and the target address is adjusted for
     STO_ALPHA_STD_GPLOAD.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_NOP
     The NOP relocation outputs a NOP if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BSR
     The BSR relocation outputs a BSR if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_LDA
     The LDA relocation outputs a LDA if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^16.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ALPHA_BOH
     The BOH relocation outputs a BSR if the longword displacement
     between two procedure entry points is < 2^21, or else a hint.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_I370_D12
     IBM 370/390 relocations
 -- : BFD_RELOC_CTOR
     The type of reloc used to build a constructor table - at the moment
     probably a 32 bit wide absolute relocation, but the target can
     choose.  It generally does map to one of the other relocation
     types.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ARM_PCREL_BRANCH
     ARM 26 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest two bits must be zero
     and are not stored in the instruction.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ARM_PCREL_BLX
     ARM 26 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest bit must be zero and is
     not stored in the instruction.  The 2nd lowest bit comes from a 1
     bit field in the instruction.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_THUMB_PCREL_BLX
     Thumb 22 bit pc-relative branch.  The lowest bit must be zero and
     is not stored in the instruction.  The 2nd lowest bit comes from a
     1 bit field in the instruction.
 -- : BFD_RELOC_ARM_PCREL_CALL
     ARM 26-bit pc-relative branch for an unconditional BL or BLX
     instruction.

 -- : BFD_RELOC_THUMB_PCREL_BRANCH25
     Thumb 7-, 9-, 12-, 20-, 23-, and 25-bit pc-relative branches.  The
     lowest bit must be zero and is not stored in the instruction.  Note
     that the corresponding ELF R_ARM_THM_JUMPnn constant has an "nn"
     one smaller in all cases.  Note further that BRANCH23 corresponds
     to R_ARM_THM_CALL.

     These two relocations are used by the linker to determine which of
     the entries in a C++ virtual function table are actually used.
     When the -gc-sections option is given, the linker will zero out the
     entries that are not used, so that the code for those functions
     need not be included in the output.

     VTABLE_INHERIT is a zero-space relocation used to describe to the
     linker the inheritance tree of a C++ virtual function table.  The
     relocation's symbol should be the parent class' vtable, and the
     relocation should be located at the child vtable.

     VTABLE_ENTRY is a zero-space relocation that describes the use of a
     virtual function table entry.  The reloc's symbol should refer to
     the table of the class mentioned in the code.  Off of that base, an
     offset describes the entry that is being used.  For Rela hosts,
     this offset is stored in the reloc's addend.  For Rel hosts, we are
     forced to put this offset in the reloc's section offset.

     These are only needed to support linker relaxation and can be
     ignored when not relaxing.  The field is set to the value of the
     difference assuming no relaxation.  The relocation encodes the
     position of the subtracted symbol so the linker can determine
     whether to adjust the field value.  PDIFF relocations are used for
     positive differences, NDIFF relocations are used for negative
     differences.  The difference value is treated as unsigned with
     these relocation types, giving full 8/16 value ranges.

2.11 Core files
===============

2.11.1 Core file functions
--------------------------

*Description*
These are functions pertaining to core files.

2.11.1.1 'bfd_core_file_failing_command'
........................................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_core_file_failing_command (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return a read-only string explaining which program was running when it
failed and produced the core file ABFD.

2.11.1.2 'bfd_core_file_failing_signal'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_core_file_failing_signal (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Returns the signal number which caused the core dump which generated the
file the BFD ABFD is attached to.

2.11.1.3 'bfd_core_file_pid'
............................

*Synopsis*
     int bfd_core_file_pid (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Returns the PID of the process the core dump the BFD ABFD is attached to
was generated from.

2.11.1.4 'core_file_matches_executable_p'
.........................................

*Synopsis*
     bool core_file_matches_executable_p
        (bfd *core_bfd, bfd *exec_bfd);
   *Description*
Return 'TRUE' if the core file attached to CORE_BFD was generated by a
run of the executable file attached to EXEC_BFD, 'FALSE' otherwise.

2.11.1.5 'generic_core_file_matches_executable_p'
.................................................

*Synopsis*
     bool generic_core_file_matches_executable_p
        (bfd *core_bfd, bfd *exec_bfd);
   *Description*
Return TRUE if the core file attached to CORE_BFD was generated by a run
of the executable file attached to EXEC_BFD.  The match is based on
executable basenames only.

   Note: When not able to determine the core file failing command or the
executable name, we still return TRUE even though we're not sure that
core file and executable match.  This is to avoid generating a false
warning in situations where we really don't know whether they match or
not.

2.12 Targets
============

*Description*
Each port of BFD to a different machine requires the creation of a
target back end.  All the back end provides to the root part of BFD is a
structure containing pointers to functions which perform certain low
level operations on files.  BFD translates the applications's requests
through a pointer into calls to the back end routines.

   When a file is opened with 'bfd_openr', its format and target are
unknown.  BFD uses various mechanisms to determine how to interpret the
file.  The operations performed are:

   * Create a BFD by calling the internal routine '_bfd_new_bfd', then
     call 'bfd_find_target' with the target string supplied to
     'bfd_openr' and the new BFD pointer.

   * If a null target string was provided to 'bfd_find_target', look up
     the environment variable 'GNUTARGET' and use that as the target
     string.

   * If the target string is still 'NULL', or the target string is
     'default', then use the first item in the target vector as the
     target type, and set 'target_defaulted' in the BFD to cause
     'bfd_check_format' to loop through all the targets.  *Note
     bfd_target::.  *Note Formats::.

   * Otherwise, inspect the elements in the target vector one by one,
     until a match on target name is found.  When found, use it.

   * Otherwise return the error 'bfd_error_invalid_target' to
     'bfd_openr'.

   * 'bfd_openr' attempts to open the file using 'bfd_open_file', and
     returns the BFD.
   Once the BFD has been opened and the target selected, the file format
may be determined.  This is done by calling 'bfd_check_format' on the
BFD with a suggested format.  If 'target_defaulted' has been set, each
possible target type is tried to see if it recognizes the specified
format.  'bfd_check_format' returns 'TRUE' when the caller guesses
right.

2.12.1 bfd_target
-----------------

*Description*
This structure contains everything that BFD knows about a target.  It
includes things like its byte order, name, and which routines to call to
do various operations.

   Every BFD points to a target structure with its 'xvec' member.

   The macros below are used to dispatch to functions through the
'bfd_target' vector.  They are used in a number of macros further down
in 'bfd.h', and are also used when calling various routines by hand
inside the BFD implementation.  The ARGLIST argument must be
parenthesized; it contains all the arguments to the called function.

   They make the documentation (more) unpleasant to read, so if someone
wants to fix this and not break the above, please do.
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
       ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist)

     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND
     #define BFD_SEND(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
         ((*((bfd)->xvec->message)) arglist) : \
         (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif
   For operations which index on the BFD format:
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int) ((bfd)->format)]) arglist)

     #ifdef DEBUG_BFD_SEND
     #undef BFD_SEND_FMT
     #define BFD_SEND_FMT(bfd, message, arglist) \
       (((bfd) && (bfd)->xvec && (bfd)->xvec->message) ? \
        (((bfd)->xvec->message[(int) ((bfd)->format)]) arglist) : \
        (bfd_assert (__FILE__,__LINE__), NULL))
     #endif

     /* Defined to TRUE if unused section symbol should be kept.  */
     #ifndef TARGET_KEEP_UNUSED_SECTION_SYMBOLS
     #define TARGET_KEEP_UNUSED_SECTION_SYMBOLS true
     #endif

   This is the structure which defines the type of BFD this is.  The
'xvec' member of the struct 'bfd' itself points here.  Each module that
implements access to a different target under BFD, defines one of these.

   FIXME, these names should be rationalised with the names of the entry
points which call them.  Too bad we can't have one macro to define them
both!

2.12.1.1 '_bfd_per_xvec_warn'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     struct per_xvec_message **_bfd_per_xvec_warn (const bfd_target *, size_t);
   *Description*
Return a location for the given target xvec to use for warnings specific
to that target.  If TARG is NULL, returns the array of per_xvec_message
pointers, otherwise if ALLOC is zero, returns a pointer to a pointer to
the list of messages for TARG, otherwise (both TARG and ALLOC non-zero),
allocates a new per_xvec_message with space for a string of ALLOC bytes
and returns a pointer to a pointer to it.  May return a pointer to a
NULL pointer on allocation failure.

2.12.1.2 'bfd_set_default_target'
.................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_set_default_target (const char *name);
   *Description*
Set the default target vector to use when recognizing a BFD. This takes
the name of the target, which may be a BFD target name or a
configuration triplet.

2.12.1.3 'bfd_find_target'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_find_target (const char *target_name, bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to the transfer vector for the object target named
TARGET_NAME.  If TARGET_NAME is 'NULL', choose the one in the
environment variable 'GNUTARGET'; if that is null or not defined, then
choose the first entry in the target list.  Passing in the string
"default" or setting the environment variable to "default" will cause
the first entry in the target list to be returned, and
"target_defaulted" will be set in the BFD if ABFD isn't 'NULL'.  This
causes 'bfd_check_format' to loop over all the targets to find the one
that matches the file being read.

2.12.1.4 'bfd_get_target_info'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_get_target_info (const char *target_name,
         bfd *abfd,
         bool *is_bigendian,
         int *underscoring,
         const char **def_target_arch);
   *Description*
Return a pointer to the transfer vector for the object target named
TARGET_NAME.  If TARGET_NAME is 'NULL', choose the one in the
environment variable 'GNUTARGET'; if that is null or not defined, then
choose the first entry in the target list.  Passing in the string
"default" or setting the environment variable to "default" will cause
the first entry in the target list to be returned, and
"target_defaulted" will be set in the BFD if ABFD isn't 'NULL'.  This
causes 'bfd_check_format' to loop over all the targets to find the one
that matches the file being read.  If IS_BIGENDIAN is not 'NULL', then
set this value to target's endian mode.  True for big-endian, FALSE for
little-endian or for invalid target.  If UNDERSCORING is not 'NULL',
then set this value to target's underscoring mode.  Zero for
none-underscoring, -1 for invalid target, else the value of target
vector's symbol underscoring.  If DEF_TARGET_ARCH is not 'NULL', then
set it to the architecture string specified by the target_name.

2.12.1.5 'bfd_target_list'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     const char ** bfd_target_list (void);
   *Description*
Return a freshly malloced NULL-terminated vector of the names of all the
valid BFD targets.  Do not modify the names.

2.12.1.6 'bfd_iterate_over_targets'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     const bfd_target *bfd_iterate_over_targets
        (int (*func) (const bfd_target *, void *),
         void *data);
   *Description*
Call FUNC for each target in the list of BFD target vectors, passing
DATA to FUNC.  Stop iterating if FUNC returns a non-zero result, and
return that target vector.  Return NULL if FUNC always returns zero.

2.12.1.7 'bfd_flavour_name'
...........................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_flavour_name (enum bfd_flavour flavour);
   *Description*
Return the string form of FLAVOUR.

2.13 Architectures
==================

BFD keeps one atom in a BFD describing the architecture of the data
attached to the BFD: a pointer to a 'bfd_arch_info_type'.

   Pointers to structures can be requested independently of a BFD so
that an architecture's information can be interrogated without access to
an open BFD.

   The architecture information is provided by each architecture
package.  The set of default architectures is selected by the macro
'SELECT_ARCHITECTURES'.  This is normally set up in the
'config/TARGET.mt' file of your choice.  If the name is not defined,
then all the architectures supported are included.

   When BFD starts up, all the architectures are called with an
initialize method.  It is up to the architecture back end to insert as
many items into the list of architectures as it wants to; generally this
would be one for each machine and one for the default case (an item with
a machine field of 0).

   BFD's idea of an architecture is implemented in 'archures.c'.

2.13.1 bfd_architecture
-----------------------

*Description*
This enum gives the object file's CPU architecture, in a global
sense--i.e., what processor family does it belong to?  Another field
indicates which processor within the family is in use.  The machine
gives a number which distinguishes different versions of the
architecture, containing, for example, 68020 for Motorola 68020.

     /* Set to N to open the next N BFDs using an alternate id space.  */
     extern unsigned int bfd_use_reserved_id;

2.14 Opening and closing BFDs
=============================

2.14.1 Functions for opening and closing
----------------------------------------

2.14.1.1 'bfd_fopen'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fopen (const char *filename, const char *target,
         const char *mode, int fd);
   *Description*
Open the file FILENAME with the target TARGET.  Return a pointer to the
created BFD. If FD is not -1, then 'fdopen' is used to open the file;
otherwise, 'fopen' is used.  MODE is passed directly to 'fopen' or
'fdopen'.

   Calls 'bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   The new BFD is marked as cacheable iff FD is -1.

   If 'NULL' is returned then an error has occured.  Possible errors are
'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target' or 'system_call'
error.

   On error, FD is always closed.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.2 'bfd_openr'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr (const char *filename, const char *target);
   *Description*
Open the file FILENAME (using 'fopen') with the target TARGET.  Return a
pointer to the created BFD.

   Calls 'bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   If 'NULL' is returned then an error has occured.  Possible errors are
'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target' or 'system_call'
error.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.3 'bfd_fdopenr'
......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fdopenr (const char *filename, const char *target, int fd);
   *Description*
'bfd_fdopenr' is to 'bfd_fopenr' much like 'fdopen' is to 'fopen'.  It
opens a BFD on a file already described by the FD supplied.

   When the file is later 'bfd_close'd, the file descriptor will be
closed.  If the caller desires that this file descriptor be cached by
BFD (opened as needed, closed as needed to free descriptors for other
opens), with the supplied FD used as an initial file descriptor (but
subject to closure at any time), call bfd_set_cacheable(bfd, 1) on the
returned BFD. The default is to assume no caching; the file descriptor
will remain open until 'bfd_close', and will not be affected by BFD
operations on other files.

   Possible errors are 'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target'
and 'bfd_error_system_call'.

   On error, FD is closed.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.4 'bfd_fdopenw'
......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_fdopenw (const char *filename, const char *target, int fd);
   *Description*
'bfd_fdopenw' is exactly like 'bfd_fdopenr' with the exception that the
resulting BFD is suitable for output.

2.14.1.5 'bfd_openstreamr'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openstreamr (const char * filename, const char * target,
         void * stream);
   *Description*
Open a BFD for read access on an existing stdio stream.  When the BFD is
passed to 'bfd_close', the stream will be closed.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.6 'bfd_openr_iovec'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openr_iovec (const char *filename, const char *target,
         void *(*open_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *open_closure),
         void *open_closure,
         file_ptr (*pread_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *stream,
         void *buf,
         file_ptr nbytes,
         file_ptr offset),
         int (*close_func) (struct bfd *nbfd,
         void *stream),
         int (*stat_func) (struct bfd *abfd,
         void *stream,
         struct stat *sb));
   *Description*
Create and return a BFD backed by a read-only STREAM.  The STREAM is
created using OPEN_FUNC, accessed using PREAD_FUNC and destroyed using
CLOSE_FUNC.

   Calls 'bfd_find_target', so TARGET is interpreted as by that
function.

   Calls OPEN_FUNC (which can call 'bfd_zalloc' and 'bfd_get_filename')
to obtain the read-only stream backing the BFD. OPEN_FUNC either
succeeds returning the non-'NULL' STREAM, or fails returning 'NULL'
(setting 'bfd_error').

   Calls PREAD_FUNC to request NBYTES of data from STREAM starting at
OFFSET (e.g., via a call to 'bfd_read').  PREAD_FUNC either succeeds
returning the number of bytes read (which can be less than NBYTES when
end-of-file), or fails returning -1 (setting 'bfd_error').

   Calls CLOSE_FUNC when the BFD is later closed using 'bfd_close'.
CLOSE_FUNC either succeeds returning 0, or fails returning -1 (setting
'bfd_error').

   Calls STAT_FUNC to fill in a stat structure for bfd_stat,
bfd_get_size, and bfd_get_mtime calls.  STAT_FUNC returns 0 on success,
or returns -1 on failure (setting 'bfd_error').

   If 'bfd_openr_iovec' returns 'NULL' then an error has occurred.
Possible errors are 'bfd_error_no_memory', 'bfd_error_invalid_target'
and 'bfd_error_system_call'.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.7 'bfd_openw'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_openw (const char *filename, const char *target);
   *Description*
Create a BFD, associated with file FILENAME, using the file format
TARGET, and return a pointer to it.

   Possible errors are 'bfd_error_system_call', 'bfd_error_no_memory',
'bfd_error_invalid_target'.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.8 'bfd_close'
....................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_close (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Close a BFD. If the BFD was open for writing, then pending operations
are completed and the file written out and closed.  If the created file
is executable, then 'chmod' is called to mark it as such.

   All memory attached to the BFD is released.

   The file descriptor associated with the BFD is closed (even if it was
passed in to BFD by 'bfd_fdopenr').

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.9 'bfd_close_all_done'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_close_all_done (bfd *);
   *Description*
Close a BFD. Differs from 'bfd_close' since it does not complete any
pending operations.  This routine would be used if the application had
just used BFD for swapping and didn't want to use any of the writing
code.

   If the created file is executable, then 'chmod' is called to mark it
as such.

   All memory attached to the BFD is released.

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.10 'bfd_create'
......................

*Synopsis*
     bfd *bfd_create (const char *filename, bfd *templ);
   *Description*
Create a new BFD in the manner of 'bfd_openw', but without opening a
file.  The new BFD takes the target from the target used by TEMPL.  The
format is always set to 'bfd_object'.

   A copy of the FILENAME argument is stored in the newly created BFD.
It can be accessed via the bfd_get_filename() macro.

2.14.1.11 'bfd_make_writable'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_make_writable (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD as created by 'bfd_create' and converts it into one like as
returned by 'bfd_openw'.  It does this by converting the BFD to
BFD_IN_MEMORY. It's assumed that you will call 'bfd_make_readable' on
this bfd later.

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.12 'bfd_make_readable'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_make_readable (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD as created by 'bfd_create' and 'bfd_make_writable' and
converts it into one like as returned by 'bfd_openr'.  It does this by
writing the contents out to the memory buffer, then reversing the
direction.

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok, otherwise 'FALSE'.

2.14.1.13 'bfd_alloc'
.....................

*Synopsis*
     void *bfd_alloc (bfd *abfd, bfd_size_type wanted);

Return the updated CRC32 value.

2.14.1.16 'bfd_get_debug_link_info_1'
.....................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_get_debug_link_info_1 (bfd *abfd, void *crc32_out);
   *Description*
Extracts the filename and CRC32 value for any separate debug information
file associated with ABFD.

   The CRC32_OUT parameter is an untyped pointer because this routine is
used as a 'get_func_type' function, but it is expected to be an unsigned
long pointer.

   *Returns*
The filename of the associated debug information file, or NULL if there
is no such file.  If the filename was found then the contents of
CRC32_OUT are updated to hold the corresponding CRC32 value for the
file.

   The returned filename is allocated with 'malloc'; freeing it is the
responsibility of the caller.

2.14.1.17 'bfd_get_debug_link_info'
...................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_get_debug_link_info (bfd *abfd, unsigned long *crc32_out);
   *Description*
Extracts the filename and CRC32 value for any separate debug information
file associated with ABFD.

   *Returns*
The filename of the associated debug information file, or NULL if there
is no such file.  If the filename was found then the contents of
CRC32_OUT are updated to hold the corresponding CRC32 value for the
file.

   The returned filename is allocated with 'malloc'; freeing it is the
responsibility of the caller.

2.14.1.18 'bfd_get_alt_debug_link_info'

         bfd_byte **buildid_out);
   *Description*
Fetch the filename and BuildID value for any alternate debuginfo
associated with ABFD.  Return NULL if no such info found, otherwise
return filename and update BUILDID_LEN and BUILDID_OUT.  The returned
filename and build_id are allocated with 'malloc'; freeing them is the
responsibility of the caller.

2.14.1.19 'separate_debug_file_exists'
......................................

*Synopsis*
     bool separate_debug_file_exists
        (char *name, void *crc32_p);
   *Description*
Checks to see if NAME is a file and if its contents match CRC32, which
is a pointer to an 'unsigned long' containing a CRC32.

   The CRC32_P parameter is an untyped pointer because this routine is
used as a 'check_func_type' function.

2.14.1.20 'separate_alt_debug_file_exists'
..........................................

*Synopsis*
     bool separate_alt_debug_file_exists
        (char *name, void *unused);

        (bfd *abfd, const char *dir, bool include_dirs,
         get_func_type get, check_func_type check, void *data);
   *Description*
Searches for a debug information file corresponding to ABFD.

   The name of the separate debug info file is returned by the GET
function.  This function scans various fixed locations in the
filesystem, including the file tree rooted at DIR.  If the INCLUDE_DIRS
parameter is true then the directory components of ABFD's filename will
be included in the searched locations.

   DATA is passed unmodified to the GET and CHECK functions.  It is
generally used to implement build-id-like matching in the callback
functions.

   *Returns*
Returns the filename of the first file to be found which receives a TRUE
result from the CHECK function.  Returns NULL if no valid file could be
found.

2.14.1.22 'bfd_follow_gnu_debuglink'
....................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_follow_gnu_debuglink (bfd *abfd, const char *dir);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD and searches it for a .gnu_debuglink section.  If this
section is found, it examines the section for the name and checksum of a
'.debug' file containing auxiliary debugging information.  It then
searches the filesystem for this .debug file in some standard locations,
including the directory tree rooted at DIR, and if found returns the
full filename.

   If DIR is NULL, the search will take place starting at the current
directory.

   *Returns*
'NULL' on any errors or failure to locate the .debug file, otherwise a
pointer to a heap-allocated string containing the filename.  The caller
is responsible for freeing this string.

2.14.1.23 'bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink'
.......................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_follow_gnu_debugaltlink (bfd *abfd, const char *dir);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD and searches it for a .gnu_debugaltlink section.  If this
section is found, it examines the section for the name of a file
containing auxiliary debugging information.  It then searches the
filesystem for this file in a set of standard locations, including the
directory tree rooted at DIR, and if found returns the full filename.

   If DIR is NULL, the search will take place starting at the current
directory.

   *Returns*
'NULL' on any errors or failure to locate the debug file, otherwise a
pointer to a heap-allocated string containing the filename.  The caller
is responsible for freeing this string.

2.14.1.24 'bfd_create_gnu_debuglink_section'
............................................

*Synopsis*
     struct bfd_section *bfd_create_gnu_debuglink_section
        (bfd *abfd, const char *filename);
   *Description*
Takes a BFD and adds a .gnu_debuglink section to it.  The section is
sized to be big enough to contain a link to the specified FILENAME.

   *Returns*
A pointer to the new section is returned if all is ok.  Otherwise 'NULL'
is returned and bfd_error is set.

2.14.1.25 'bfd_fill_in_gnu_debuglink_section'
.............................................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_fill_in_gnu_debuglink_section
        (bfd *abfd, struct bfd_section *sect, const char *filename);
   *Description*

the contents of the section to contain a link to the specified FILENAME.
The filename should be relative to the current directory.

   *Returns*
'TRUE' is returned if all is ok.  Otherwise 'FALSE' is returned and
bfd_error is set.

2.14.1.26 'get_build_id'
........................

*Synopsis*
     struct bfd_build_id * get_build_id (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Finds the build-id associated with ABFD.  If the build-id is extracted
from the note section then a build-id structure is built for it, using
memory allocated to ABFD, and this is then attached to the ABFD.

   *Returns*
Returns a pointer to the build-id structure if a build-id could be
found.  If no build-id is found NULL is returned and error code is set.

2.14.1.27 'get_build_id_name'
.............................

*Synopsis*
     char * get_build_id_name (bfd *abfd, void *build_id_out_p)
   *Description*
Searches ABFD for a build-id, and then constructs a pathname from it.
The path is computed as .build-id/NN/NN+NN.debug where NNNN+NN is the
build-id value as a hexadecimal string.

   *Returns*
Returns the constructed filename or NULL upon error.  It is the caller's
responsibility to free the memory used to hold the filename.  If a
filename is returned then the BUILD_ID_OUT_P parameter (which points to
a 'struct bfd_build_id' pointer) is set to a pointer to the build_id
structure.

2.14.1.28 'check_build_id_file'
...............................

*Synopsis*
     bool check_build_id_file (char *name, void *buildid_p);
   *Description*
Checks to see if NAME is a readable file and if its build-id matches
BUILDID.

   *Returns*
Returns TRUE if the file exists, is readable, and contains a build-id
which matches the build-id pointed at by BUILD_ID_P (which is really a
'struct bfd_build_id **').

2.14.1.29 'bfd_follow_build_id_debuglink'
.........................................

*Synopsis*
     char *bfd_follow_build_id_debuglink (bfd *abfd, const char *dir);
   *Description*
Takes ABFD and searches it for a .note.gnu.build-id section.  If this
section is found, it extracts the value of the NT_GNU_BUILD_ID note,
which should be a hexadecimal value NNNN+NN (for 32+ hex digits).  It
then searches the filesystem for a file named .BUILD-ID/NN/NN+NN.DEBUG
in a set of standard locations, including the directory tree rooted at
DIR.  The filename of the first matching file to be found is returned.
A matching file should contain a .note.gnu.build-id section with the
same NNNN+NN note as ABFD, although this check is currently not
implemented.

   If DIR is NULL, the search will take place starting at the current
directory.

   *Returns*
'NULL' on any errors or failure to locate the debug file, otherwise a
pointer to a heap-allocated string containing the filename.  The caller
is responsible for freeing this string.

2.14.1.30 'bfd_set_filename'
............................

*Synopsis*
     const char *bfd_set_filename (bfd *abfd, const char *filename);
   *Description*

2.15 File caching
=================

The file caching mechanism is embedded within BFD and allows the
application to open as many BFDs as it wants without regard to the
underlying operating system's file descriptor limit (often as low as 20
open files).  The module in 'cache.c' maintains a least recently used
list of 'bfd_cache_max_open' files, and exports the name
'bfd_cache_lookup', which runs around and makes sure that the required
BFD is open.  If not, then it chooses a file to close, closes it and
opens the one wanted, returning its file handle.

2.15.1 Caching functions
------------------------

2.15.1.1 'bfd_cache_init'
.........................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_cache_init (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Add a newly opened BFD to the cache.

2.15.1.2 'bfd_cache_close'
..........................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_cache_close (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Remove the BFD ABFD from the cache.  If the attached file is open, then
close it too.

   *Returns*
'FALSE' is returned if closing the file fails, 'TRUE' is returned if all
is well.

2.15.1.3 'bfd_cache_close_all'
..............................

*Synopsis*
     bool bfd_cache_close_all (void);
   *Description*

'FALSE' is returned if closing one of the file fails, 'TRUE' is returned
if all is well.

2.15.1.4 'bfd_open_file'
........................

*Synopsis*
     FILE* bfd_open_file (bfd *abfd);
   *Description*
Call the OS to open a file for ABFD.  Return the 'FILE *' (possibly
'NULL') that results from this operation.  Set up the BFD so that future
accesses know the file is open.  If the 'FILE *' returned is 'NULL',
then it won't have been put in the cache, so it won't have to be removed
from it.

2.16 Linker Functions
=====================

The linker uses three special entry points in the BFD target vector.  It
is not necessary to write special routines for these entry points when
creating a new BFD back end, since generic versions are provided.
However, writing them can speed up linking and make it use significantly
less runtime memory.

   The first routine creates a hash table used by the other routines.
The second routine adds the symbols from an object file to the hash
table.  The third routine takes all the object files and links them
together to create the output file.  These routines are designed so that
the linker proper does not need to know anything about the symbols in
the object files that it is linking.  The linker merely arranges the
sections as directed by the linker script and lets BFD handle the
details of symbols and relocs.

   The second routine and third routines are passed a pointer to a
'struct bfd_link_info' structure (defined in 'bfdlink.h') which holds
information relevant to the link, including the linker hash table (which
was created by the first routine) and a set of callback functions to the
linker proper.

   The generic linker routines are in 'linker.c', and use the header
file 'genlink.h'.  As of this writing, the only back ends which have
implemented versions of these routines are a.out (in 'aoutx.h') and
ECOFF (in 'ecoff.c').  The a.out routines are used as examples
throughout this section.

2.16.1 Creating a linker hash table
-----------------------------------

The linker routines must create a hash table, which must be derived from
'struct bfd_link_hash_table' described in 'bfdlink.c'.  *Note Hash
Tables::, for information on how to create a derived hash table.  This
entry point is called using the target vector of the linker output file.

   The '_bfd_link_hash_table_create' entry point must allocate and
initialize an instance of the desired hash table.  If the back end does
not require any additional information to be stored with the entries in
the hash table, the entry point may simply create a 'struct
bfd_link_hash_table'.  Most likely, however, some additional information
will be needed.

   For example, with each entry in the hash table the a.out linker keeps
the index the symbol has in the final output file (this index number is
used so that when doing a relocatable link the symbol index used in the
output file can be quickly filled in when copying over a reloc).  The
a.out linker code defines the required structures and functions for a
hash table derived from 'struct bfd_link_hash_table'.  The a.out linker
hash table is created by the function
'NAME(aout,link_hash_table_create)'; it simply allocates space for the
hash table, initializes it, and returns a pointer to it.

   When writing the linker routines for a new back end, you will
generally not know exactly which fields will be required until you have
finished.  You should simply create a new hash table which defines no
additional fields, and then simply add fields as they become necessary.

2.16.2 Adding symbols to the hash table
---------------------------------------

The linker proper will call the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry point for
each object file or archive which is to be linked (typically these are
the files named on the command line, but some may also come from the
linker script).  The entry point is responsible for examining the file.
For an object file, BFD must add any relevant symbol information to the
hash table.  For an archive, BFD must determine which elements of the
archive should be used and adding them to the link.

   The a.out version of this entry point is
'NAME(aout,link_add_symbols)'.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Differing file formats,  Next: Adding symbols from an object file,  Prev: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table,  Up: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table

2.16.2.1 Differing file formats
...............................

Normally all the files involved in a link will be of the same format,
but it is also possible to link together different format object files,
and the back end must support that.  The '_bfd_link_add_symbols' entry
point is called via the target vector of the file to be added.  This has
an important consequence: the function may not assume that the hash
table is the type created by the corresponding
'_bfd_link_hash_table_create' vector.  All the '_bfd_link_add_symbols'
function can assume about the hash table is that it is derived from
'struct bfd_link_hash_table'.

   Sometimes the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' function must store some
information in the hash table entry to be used by the '_bfd_final_link'
function.  In such a case the output bfd xvec must be checked to make
sure that the hash table was created by an object file of the same
format.

   The '_bfd_final_link' routine must be prepared to handle a hash entry
without any extra information added by the '_bfd_link_add_symbols'
function.  A hash entry without extra information will also occur when
the linker script directs the linker to create a symbol.  Note that,
regardless of how a hash table entry is added, all the fields will be
initialized to some sort of null value by the hash table entry
initialization function.

   See 'ecoff_link_add_externals' for an example of how to check the
output bfd before saving information (in this case, the ECOFF external
symbol debugging information) in a hash table entry.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Adding symbols from an object file,  Next: Adding symbols from an archive,  Prev: Differing file formats,  Up: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table

2.16.2.2 Adding symbols from an object file
...........................................

When the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an object file, it
must add all externally visible symbols in that object file to the hash
table.  The actual work of adding the symbol to the hash table is
normally handled by the function '_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.
The '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is responsible for reading all the
symbols from the object file and passing the correct information to
'_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol'.

   The '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should not use
'bfd_canonicalize_symtab' to read the symbols.  The point of providing
this routine is to avoid the overhead of converting the symbols into
generic 'asymbol' structures.

   '_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' handles the details of combining
common symbols, warning about multiple definitions, and so forth.  It
takes arguments which describe the symbol to add, notably symbol flags,
a section, and an offset.  The symbol flags include such things as
'BSF_WEAK' or 'BSF_INDIRECT'.  The section is a section in the object
file, or something like 'bfd_und_section_ptr' for an undefined symbol or
'bfd_com_section_ptr' for a common symbol.

   If the '_bfd_final_link' routine is also going to need to read the
symbol information, the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine should save it
somewhere attached to the object file BFD. However, the information
should only be saved if the 'keep_memory' field of the 'info' argument
is TRUE, so that the '-no-keep-memory' linker switch is effective.

   The a.out function which adds symbols from an object file is
'aout_link_add_object_symbols', and most of the interesting work is in
'aout_link_add_symbols'.  The latter saves pointers to the hash tables
entries created by '_bfd_generic_link_add_one_symbol' indexed by symbol
number, so that the '_bfd_final_link' routine does not have to call the
hash table lookup routine to locate the entry.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Adding symbols from an archive,  Prev: Adding symbols from an object file,  Up: Adding Symbols to the Hash Table

2.16.2.3 Adding symbols from an archive
.......................................

When the '_bfd_link_add_symbols' routine is passed an archive, it must
look through the symbols defined by the archive and decide which
elements of the archive should be included in the link.  For each such
element it must call the 'add_archive_element' linker callback, and it
must add the symbols from the object file to the linker hash table.
(The callback may in fact indicate that a replacement BFD should be
used, in which case the symbols from that BFD should be added to the
linker hash table instead.)

   In most cases the work of looking through the symbols in the archive
should be done by the '_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' function.
'_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' is passed a function to call to
make the final decision about adding an archive element to the link and
to do the actual work of adding the symbols to the linker hash table.
If the element is to be included, the 'add_archive_element' linker
callback routine must be called with the element as an argument, and the
element's symbols must be added to the linker hash table just as though
the element had itself been passed to the '_bfd_link_add_symbols'
function.

   When the a.out '_bfd_link_add_symbols' function receives an archive,
it calls '_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols' passing
'aout_link_check_archive_element' as the function argument.
'aout_link_check_archive_element' calls 'aout_link_check_ar_symbols'.
If the latter decides to add the element (an element is only added if it
provides a real, non-common, definition for a previously undefined or
common symbol) it calls the 'add_archive_element' callback and then
'aout_link_check_archive_element' calls 'aout_link_add_symbols' to
actually add the symbols to the linker hash table - possibly those of a
substitute BFD, if the 'add_archive_element' callback avails itself of
that option.

   The ECOFF back end is unusual in that it does not normally call
'_bfd_generic_link_add_archive_symbols', because ECOFF archives already
contain a hash table of symbols.  The ECOFF back end searches the
archive itself to avoid the overhead of creating a new hash table.

2.16.3 Performing the final link
--------------------------------

When all the input files have been processed, the linker calls the
'_bfd_final_link' entry point of the output BFD. This routine is
responsible for producing the final output file, which has several
aspects.  It must relocate the contents of the input sections and copy
the data into the output sections.  It must build an output symbol table
including any local symbols from the input files and the global symbols
from the hash table.  When producing relocatable output, it must modify
the input relocs and write them into the output file.  There may also be
object format dependent work to be done.

   The linker will also call the 'write_object_contents' entry point
when the BFD is closed.  The two entry points must work together in
order to produce the correct output file.

   The details of how this works are inevitably dependent upon the
specific object file format.  The a.out '_bfd_final_link' routine is
'NAME(aout,final_link)'.

2.16.3.1 Information provided by the linker
...........................................

Before the linker calls the '_bfd_final_link' entry point, it sets up
some data structures for the function to use.

   The 'input_bfds' field of the 'bfd_link_info' structure will point to
a list of all the input files included in the link.  These files are
linked through the 'link.next' field of the 'bfd' structure.

   Each section in the output file will have a list of 'link_order'
structures attached to the 'map_head.link_order' field (the 'link_order'
structure is defined in 'bfdlink.h').  These structures describe how to
create the contents of the output section in terms of the contents of
various input sections, fill constants, and, eventually, other types of
information.  They also describe relocs that must be created by the BFD
backend, but do not correspond to any input file; this is used to
support -Ur, which builds constructors while generating a relocatable
object file.

2.16.3.2 Relocating the section contents
........................................

The '_bfd_final_link' function should look through the 'link_order'
structures attached to each section of the output file.  Each
'link_order' structure should either be handled specially, or it should
be passed to the function '_bfd_default_link_order' which will do the
right thing ('_bfd_default_link_order' is defined in 'linker.c').

   For efficiency, a 'link_order' of type 'bfd_indirect_link_order'
whose associated section belongs to a BFD of the same format as the
output BFD must be handled specially.  This type of 'link_order'
describes part of an output section in terms of a section belonging to
one of the input files.  The '_bfd_final_link' function should read the
contents of the section and any associated relocs, apply the relocs to
the section contents, and write out the modified section contents.  If
performing a relocatable link, the relocs themselves must also be
modified and written out.

   The functions '_bfd_relocate_contents' and '_bfd_final_link_relocate'
provide some general support for performing the actual relocations,
notably overflow checking.  Their arguments include information about
the symbol the relocation is against and a 'reloc_howto_type' argument
which describes the relocation to perform.  These functions are defined
in 'reloc.c'.

   The a.out function which handles reading, relocating, and writing
section contents is 'aout_link_input_section'.  The actual relocation is
done in 'aout_link_input_section_std' and 'aout_link_input_section_ext'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Writing the symbol table,  Prev: Relocating the section contents,  Up: Performing the Final Link

2.16.3.3 Writing the symbol table
.................................

The '_bfd_final_link' function must gather all the symbols in the input
files and write them out.  It must also write out all the symbols in the
global hash table.  This must be controlled by the 'strip' and 'discard'
fields of the 'bfd_link_info' structure.

   The local symbols of the input files will not have been entered into
the linker hash table.  The '_bfd_final_link' routine must consider each
input file and include the symbols in the output file.  It may be
convenient to do this when looking through the 'link_order' structures,
or it may be done by stepping through the 'input_bfds' list.

   The '_bfd_final_link' routine must also traverse the global hash
table to gather all the externally visible symbols.  It is possible that
most of the externally visible symbols may be written out when
considering the symbols of each input file, but it is still necessary to
traverse the hash table since the linker script may have defined some
symbols that are not in any of the input files.

   The 'strip' field of the 'bfd_link_info' structure controls which
symbols are written out.  The possible values are listed in 'bfdlink.h'.
If the value is 'strip_some', then the 'keep_hash' field of the
'bfd_link_info' structure is a hash table of symbols to keep; each
symbol should be looked up in this hash table, and only symbols which
are present should be included in the output file.

   If the 'strip' field of the 'bfd_link_info' structure permits local
symbols to be written out, the 'discard' field is used to further
controls which local symbols are included in the output file.  If the
value is 'discard_l', then all local symbols which begin with a certain
prefix are discarded; this is controlled by the
'bfd_is_local_label_name' entry point.

   The a.out backend handles symbols by calling
'aout_link_write_symbols' on each input BFD and then traversing the
global hash table with the function 'aout_link_write_other_symbol'.  It
builds a string table while writing out the symbols, which is written to
the output file at the end of 'NAME(aout,final_link)'.

2.17 Hash Tables
================

BFD provides a simple set of hash table functions.  Routines are
provided to initialize a hash table, to free a hash table, to look up a
string in a hash table and optionally create an entry for it, and to
traverse a hash table.  There is currently no routine to delete an
string from a hash table.

   The basic hash table does not permit any data to be stored with a
string.  However, a hash table is designed to present a base class from
which other types of hash tables may be derived.  These derived types
may store additional information with the string.  Hash tables were
implemented in this way, rather than simply providing a data pointer in
a hash table entry, because they were designed for use by the linker
back ends.  The linker may create thousands of hash table entries, and
the overhead of allocating private data and storing and following
pointers becomes noticeable.

   The basic hash table code is in 'hash.c'.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Creating and Freeing a Hash Table,  Next: Looking Up or Entering a String,  Prev: Hash Tables,  Up: Hash Tables

2.17.1 Creating and freeing a hash table
----------------------------------------

To create a hash table, create an instance of a 'struct bfd_hash_table'
(defined in 'bfd.h') and call 'bfd_hash_table_init' (if you know
approximately how many entries you will need, the function
'bfd_hash_table_init_n', which takes a SIZE argument, may be used).
'bfd_hash_table_init' returns 'FALSE' if some sort of error occurs.

   The function 'bfd_hash_table_init' take as an argument a function to
use to create new entries.  For a basic hash table, use the function
'bfd_hash_newfunc'.  *Note Deriving a New Hash Table Type::, for why you
would want to use a different value for this argument.

   'bfd_hash_table_init' will create an objalloc which will be used to
allocate new entries.  You may allocate memory on this objalloc using
'bfd_hash_allocate'.

   Use 'bfd_hash_table_free' to free up all the memory that has been
allocated for a hash table.  This will not free up the 'struct
bfd_hash_table' itself, which you must provide.

   Use 'bfd_hash_set_default_size' to set the default size of hash table
to use.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Looking Up or Entering a String,  Next: Traversing a Hash Table,  Prev: Creating and Freeing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.17.2 Looking up or entering a string
--------------------------------------

The function 'bfd_hash_lookup' is used both to look up a string in the
hash table and to create a new entry.

   If the CREATE argument is 'FALSE', 'bfd_hash_lookup' will look up a
string.  If the string is found, it will returns a pointer to a 'struct
bfd_hash_entry'.  If the string is not found in the table
'bfd_hash_lookup' will return 'NULL'.  You should not modify any of the
fields in the returns 'struct bfd_hash_entry'.

   If the CREATE argument is 'TRUE', the string will be entered into the
hash table if it is not already there.  Either way a pointer to a
'struct bfd_hash_entry' will be returned, either to the existing
structure or to a newly created one.  In this case, a 'NULL' return
means that an error occurred.

   If the CREATE argument is 'TRUE', and a new entry is created, the
COPY argument is used to decide whether to copy the string onto the hash
table objalloc or not.  If COPY is passed as 'FALSE', you must be
careful not to deallocate or modify the string as long as the hash table
exists.

2.17.3 Traversing a hash table
------------------------------

The function 'bfd_hash_traverse' may be used to traverse a hash table,
calling a function on each element.  The traversal is done in a random
order.

   'bfd_hash_traverse' takes as arguments a function and a generic 'void
*' pointer.  The function is called with a hash table entry (a 'struct
bfd_hash_entry *') and the generic pointer passed to
'bfd_hash_traverse'.  The function must return a 'boolean' value, which
indicates whether to continue traversing the hash table.  If the
function returns 'FALSE', 'bfd_hash_traverse' will stop the traversal
and return immediately.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Deriving a New Hash Table Type,  Prev: Traversing a Hash Table,  Up: Hash Tables

2.17.4 Deriving a new hash table type
-------------------------------------

Many uses of hash tables want to store additional information which each
entry in the hash table.  Some also find it convenient to store
additional information with the hash table itself.  This may be done
using a derived hash table.

   Since C is not an object oriented language, creating a derived hash
table requires sticking together some boilerplate routines with a few
differences specific to the type of hash table you want to create.

   An example of a derived hash table is the linker hash table.  The
structures for this are defined in 'bfdlink.h'.  The functions are in
'linker.c'.

   You may also derive a hash table from an already derived hash table.
For example, the a.out linker backend code uses a hash table derived
from the linker hash table.

File: bfd.info,  Node: Define the Derived Structures,  Next: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Prev: Deriving a New Hash Table Type,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.17.4.1 Define the derived structures
......................................

You must define a structure for an entry in the hash table, and a
structure for the hash table itself.

   The first field in the structure for an entry in the hash table must
be of the type used for an entry in the hash table you are deriving
from.  If you are deriving from a basic hash table this is 'struct
bfd_hash_entry', which is defined in 'bfd.h'.  The first field in the
structure for the hash table itself must be of the type of the hash
table you are deriving from itself.  If you are deriving from a basic
hash table, this is 'struct bfd_hash_table'.

   For example, the linker hash table defines 'struct
bfd_link_hash_entry' (in 'bfdlink.h').  The first field, 'root', is of
type 'struct bfd_hash_entry'.  Similarly, the first field in 'struct
bfd_link_hash_table', 'table', is of type 'struct bfd_hash_table'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Next: Write Other Derived Routines,  Prev: Define the Derived Structures,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.17.4.2 Write the derived creation routine
...........................................

You must write a routine which will create and initialize an entry in
the hash table.  This routine is passed as the function argument to
'bfd_hash_table_init'.

   In order to permit other hash tables to be derived from the hash
table you are creating, this routine must be written in a standard way.

   The first argument to the creation routine is a pointer to a hash
table entry.  This may be 'NULL', in which case the routine should
allocate the right amount of space.  Otherwise the space has already
been allocated by a hash table type derived from this one.

   After allocating space, the creation routine must call the creation
routine of the hash table type it is derived from, passing in a pointer
to the space it just allocated.  This will initialize any fields used by
the base hash table.

   Finally the creation routine must initialize any local fields for the
new hash table type.

   Here is a boilerplate example of a creation routine.  FUNCTION_NAME
is the name of the routine.  ENTRY_TYPE is the type of an entry in the
hash table you are creating.  BASE_NEWFUNC is the name of the creation
routine of the hash table type your hash table is derived from.

     struct bfd_hash_entry *
     FUNCTION_NAME (struct bfd_hash_entry *entry,
                          struct bfd_hash_table *table,
                          const char *string)
     {
       struct ENTRY_TYPE *ret = (ENTRY_TYPE *) entry;

      /* Allocate the structure if it has not already been allocated by a
         derived class.  */
       if (ret == NULL)
         {
           ret = bfd_hash_allocate (table, sizeof (* ret));
           if (ret == NULL)
             return NULL;
         }

      /* Call the allocation method of the base class.  */
       ret = ((ENTRY_TYPE *)
              BASE_NEWFUNC ((struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret, table, string));

      /* Initialize the local fields here.  */

       return (struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret;
     }
   *Description*
The creation routine for the linker hash table, which is in 'linker.c',
looks just like this example.  FUNCTION_NAME is
'_bfd_link_hash_newfunc'.  ENTRY_TYPE is 'struct bfd_link_hash_entry'.
BASE_NEWFUNC is 'bfd_hash_newfunc', the creation routine for a basic
hash table.

   '_bfd_link_hash_newfunc' also initializes the local fields in a
linker hash table entry: 'type', 'written' and 'next'.


File: bfd.info,  Node: Write Other Derived Routines,  Prev: Write the Derived Creation Routine,  Up: Deriving a New Hash Table Type

2.17.4.3 Write other derived routines
.....................................

You will want to write other routines for your new hash table, as well.

   You will want an initialization routine which calls the
initialization routine of the hash table you are deriving from and
initializes any other local fields.  For the linker hash table, this is
'_bfd_link_hash_table_init' in 'linker.c'.

   You will want a lookup routine which calls the lookup routine of the
hash table you are deriving from and casts the result.  The linker hash
table uses 'bfd_link_hash_lookup' in 'linker.c' (this actually takes an
additional argument which it uses to decide how to return the looked up
value).

   You may want a traversal routine.  This should just call the
traversal routine of the hash table you are deriving from with
appropriate casts.  The linker hash table uses 'bfd_link_hash_traverse'
in 'linker.c'.

   These routines may simply be defined as macros.  For example, the
a.out backend linker hash table, which is derived from the linker hash
table, uses macros for the lookup and traversal routines.  These are
'aout_link_hash_lookup' and 'aout_link_hash_traverse' in aoutx.h.

All of BFD lives in one directory.


File: bfd.info,  Node: aout,  Next: coff,  Prev: What to Put Where,  Up: BFD back ends

3.2 a.out backends
==================

*Description*
BFD supports a number of different flavours of a.out format, though the
major differences are only the sizes of the structures on disk, and the
shape of the relocation information.

   The support is split into a basic support file 'aoutx.h' and other
files which derive functions from the base.  One derivation file is
'aoutf1.h' (for a.out flavour 1), and adds to the basic a.out functions
support for sun3, sun4, and 386 a.out files, to create a target jump
vector for a specific target.

   This information is further split out into more specific files for
each machine, including 'sunos.c' for sun3 and sun4, and 'demo64.c' for
a demonstration of a 64 bit a.out format.

   The base file 'aoutx.h' defines general mechanisms for reading and
writing records to and from disk and various other methods which BFD
requires.  It is included by 'aout32.c' and 'aout64.c' to form the names
'aout_32_swap_exec_header_in', 'aout_64_swap_exec_header_in', etc.

   As an example, this is what goes on to make the back end for a sun4,
from 'aout32.c':

            #define ARCH_SIZE 32
            #include "aoutx.h"

   Which exports names:

            ...
            aout_32_canonicalize_reloc
            aout_32_find_nearest_line
            aout_32_get_lineno
            aout_32_get_reloc_upper_bound
            ...

   from 'sunos.c':

            #define TARGET_NAME "a.out-sunos-big"
            #define VECNAME    sparc_aout_sunos_be_vec
            #include "aoutf1.h"

   requires all the names from 'aout32.c', and produces the jump vector

            sparc_aout_sunos_be_vec

   The file 'host-aout.c' is a special case.  It is for a large set of
hosts that use "more or less standard" a.out files, and for which
cross-debugging is not interesting.  It uses the standard 32-bit a.out
support routines, but determines the file offsets and addresses of the
text, data, and BSS sections, the machine architecture and machine type,
and the entry point address, in a host-dependent manner.  Once these
values have been determined, generic code is used to handle the object
file.

   When porting it to run on a new system, you must supply:

             HOST_PAGE_SIZE
             HOST_SEGMENT_SIZE
             HOST_MACHINE_ARCH       (optional)
             HOST_MACHINE_MACHINE    (optional)
             HOST_TEXT_START_ADDR
             HOST_STACK_END_ADDR

   in the file '../include/sys/h-XXX.h' (for your host).  These values,
plus the structures and macros defined in 'a.out.h' on your host system,
will produce a BFD target that will access ordinary a.out files on your
host.  To configure a new machine to use 'host-aout.c', specify:

            TDEFAULTS = -DDEFAULT_VECTOR=host_aout_big_vec
            TDEPFILES= host-aout.o trad-core.o

   in the 'config/XXX.mt' file, and modify 'configure.ac' to use the
'XXX.mt' file (by setting "'bfd_target=XXX'") when your configuration is
selected.

3.2.1 Relocations
-----------------

*Description*
The file 'aoutx.h' provides for both the _standard_ and _extended_ forms
of a.out relocation records.

   The standard records contain only an address, a symbol index, and a
type field.  The extended records also have a full integer for an
addend.

3.2.2 Internal entry points
---------------------------

*Description*
'aoutx.h' exports several routines for accessing the contents of an
a.out file, which are gathered and exported in turn by various format
specific files (eg sunos.c).

3.3 coff backends
=================

BFD supports a number of different flavours of coff format.  The major
differences between formats are the sizes and alignments of fields in
structures on disk, and the occasional extra field.

   Coff in all its varieties is implemented with a few common files and
a number of implementation specific files.  For example, the i386 coff
format is implemented in the file 'coff-i386.c'.  This file '#include's
'coff/i386.h' which defines the external structure of the coff format
for the i386, and 'coff/internal.h' which defines the internal
structure.  'coff-i386.c' also defines the relocations used by the i386
coff format *Note Relocations::.

3.3.1 Porting to a new version of coff
--------------------------------------

The recommended method is to select from the existing implementations
the version of coff which is most like the one you want to use.  For
example, we'll say that i386 coff is the one you select, and that your
coff flavour is called foo.  Copy 'i386coff.c' to 'foocoff.c', copy
'../include/coff/i386.h' to '../include/coff/foo.h', and add the lines
to 'targets.c' and 'Makefile.in' so that your new back end is used.
Alter the shapes of the structures in '../include/coff/foo.h' so that
they match what you need.  You will probably also have to add '#ifdef's
to the code in 'coff/internal.h' and 'coffcode.h' if your version of
coff is too wild.

   You can verify that your new BFD backend works quite simply by
building 'objdump' from the 'binutils' directory, and making sure that
its version of what's going on and your host system's idea (assuming it
has the pretty standard coff dump utility, usually called 'att-dump' or
just 'dump') are the same.  Then clean up your code, and send what
you've done to Cygnus.  Then your stuff will be in the next release, and
you won't have to keep integrating it.

3.3.2 How the coff backend works
--------------------------------

3.3.2.1 File layout
...................

The Coff backend is split into generic routines that are applicable to
any Coff target and routines that are specific to a particular target.
The target-specific routines are further split into ones which are
basically the same for all Coff targets except that they use the
external symbol format or use different values for certain constants.

   The generic routines are in 'coffgen.c'.  These routines work for any
Coff target.  They use some hooks into the target specific code; the
hooks are in a 'bfd_coff_backend_data' structure, one of which exists
for each target.

   The essentially similar target-specific routines are in 'coffcode.h'.
This header file includes executable C code.  The various Coff targets
first include the appropriate Coff header file, make any special defines
that are needed, and then include 'coffcode.h'.

   Some of the Coff targets then also have additional routines in the
target source file itself.

3.3.2.2 Coff long section names
...............................

In the standard Coff object format, section names are limited to the
eight bytes available in the 's_name' field of the 'SCNHDR' section
header structure.  The format requires the field to be NUL-padded, but
not necessarily NUL-terminated, so the longest section names permitted
are a full eight characters.

   The Microsoft PE variants of the Coff object file format add an
extension to support the use of long section names.  This extension is
defined in section 4 of the Microsoft PE/COFF specification (rev 8.1).
If a section name is too long to fit into the section header's 's_name'
field, it is instead placed into the string table, and the 's_name'
field is filled with a slash ("/") followed by the ASCII decimal
representation of the offset of the full name relative to the string
table base.

   Note that this implies that the extension can only be used in object
files, as executables do not contain a string table.  The standard
specifies that long section names from objects emitted into executable
images are to be truncated.

   However, as a GNU extension, BFD can generate executable images that
contain a string table and long section names.  This would appear to be
technically valid, as the standard only says that Coff debugging
information is deprecated, not forbidden, and in practice it works,
although some tools that parse PE files expecting the MS standard format
may become confused; 'PEview' is one known example.

   The functionality is supported in BFD by code implemented under the
control of the macro 'COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES'.  If not defined, the
format does not support long section names in any way.  If defined, it
is used to initialise a flag, '_bfd_coff_long_section_names', and a hook
function pointer, '_bfd_coff_set_long_section_names', in the Coff
backend data structure.  The flag controls the generation of long
section names in output BFDs at runtime; if it is false, as it will be
by default when generating an executable image, long section names are
truncated; if true, the long section names extension is employed.  The
hook points to a function that allows the value of the flag to be
altered at runtime, on formats that support long section names at all;
on other formats it points to a stub that returns an error indication.

   With input BFDs, the flag is set according to whether any long
section names are detected while reading the section headers.  For a
completely new BFD, the flag is set to the default for the target
format.  This information can be used by a client of the BFD library
when deciding what output format to generate, and means that a BFD that
is opened for read and subsequently converted to a writeable BFD and
modified in-place will retain whatever format it had on input.

   If 'COFF_LONG_SECTION_NAMES' is simply defined (blank), or is defined
to the value "1", then long section names are enabled by default; if it
is defined to the value zero, they are disabled by default (but still
accepted in input BFDs).  The header 'coffcode.h' defines a macro,
'COFF_DEFAULT_LONG_SECTION_NAMES', which is used in the backends to
initialise the backend data structure fields appropriately; see the
comments for further detail.

3.3.2.3 Bit twiddling
.....................

Each flavour of coff supported in BFD has its own header file describing
the external layout of the structures.  There is also an internal
description of the coff layout, in 'coff/internal.h'.  A major function
of the coff backend is swapping the bytes and twiddling the bits to
translate the external form of the structures into the normal internal
form.  This is all performed in the 'bfd_swap'_thing_direction routines.
Some elements are different sizes between different versions of coff; it
is the duty of the coff version specific include file to override the
definitions of various packing routines in 'coffcode.h'.  E.g., the size
of line number entry in coff is sometimes 16 bits, and sometimes 32
bits.  '#define'ing 'PUT_LNSZ_LNNO' and 'GET_LNSZ_LNNO' will select the
correct one.  No doubt, some day someone will find a version of coff
which has a varying field size not catered to at the moment.  To port
BFD, that person will have to add more '#defines'.  Three of the bit
twiddling routines are exported to 'gdb'; 'coff_swap_aux_in',
'coff_swap_sym_in' and 'coff_swap_lineno_in'.  'GDB' reads the symbol
table on its own, but uses BFD to fix things up.  More of the bit
twiddlers are exported for 'gas'; 'coff_swap_aux_out',
'coff_swap_sym_out', 'coff_swap_lineno_out', 'coff_swap_reloc_out',
'coff_swap_filehdr_out', 'coff_swap_aouthdr_out',
'coff_swap_scnhdr_out'.  'Gas' currently keeps track of all the symbol
table and reloc drudgery itself, thereby saving the internal BFD
overhead, but uses BFD to swap things on the way out, making cross ports
much safer.  Doing so also allows BFD (and thus the linker) to use the
same header files as 'gas', which makes one avenue to disaster
disappear.

3.3.2.4 Symbol reading
......................

The simple canonical form for symbols used by BFD is not rich enough to
keep all the information available in a coff symbol table.  The back end
gets around this problem by keeping the original symbol table around,
"behind the scenes".

   When a symbol table is requested (through a call to
'bfd_canonicalize_symtab'), a request gets through to
'coff_get_normalized_symtab'.  This reads the symbol table from the coff
file and swaps all the structures inside into the internal form.  It
also fixes up all the pointers in the table (represented in the file by
offsets from the first symbol in the table) into physical pointers to
elements in the new internal table.  This involves some work since the
meanings of fields change depending upon context: a field that is a
pointer to another structure in the symbol table at one moment may be
the size in bytes of a structure at the next.  Another pass is made over
the table.  All symbols which mark file names ('C_FILE' symbols) are
modified so that the internal string points to the value in the auxent
(the real filename) rather than the normal text associated with the
symbol ('".file"').

   At this time the symbol names are moved around.  Coff stores all
symbols less than nine characters long physically within the symbol
table; longer strings are kept at the end of the file in the string
table.  This pass moves all strings into memory and replaces them with
pointers to the strings.

   The symbol table is massaged once again, this time to create the
canonical table used by the BFD application.  Each symbol is inspected
in turn, and a decision made (using the 'sclass' field) about the
various flags to set in the 'asymbol'.  *Note Symbols::.  The generated
canonical table shares strings with the hidden internal symbol table.

   Any linenumbers are read from the coff file too, and attached to the
symbols which own the functions the linenumbers belong to.

3.3.2.5 Symbol writing
......................

Writing a symbol to a coff file which didn't come from a coff file will
lose any debugging information.  The 'asymbol' structure remembers the
BFD from which the symbol was taken, and on output the back end makes
sure that the same destination target as source target is present.

   When the symbols have come from a coff file then all the debugging
information is preserved.

   Symbol tables are provided for writing to the back end in a vector of
pointers to pointers.  This allows applications like the linker to
accumulate and output large symbol tables without having to do too much
byte copying.

   This function runs through the provided symbol table and patches each
symbol marked as a file place holder ('C_FILE') to point to the next
file place holder in the list.  It also marks each 'offset' field in the
list with the offset from the first symbol of the current symbol.

   Another function of this procedure is to turn the canonical value
form of BFD into the form used by coff.  Internally, BFD expects symbol
values to be offsets from a section base; so a symbol physically at
0x120, but in a section starting at 0x100, would have the value 0x20.
Coff expects symbols to contain their final value, so symbols have their
values changed at this point to reflect their sum with their owning
section.  This transformation uses the 'output_section' field of the
'asymbol''s 'asection' *Note Sections::.

   * 'coff_mangle_symbols'
   This routine runs though the provided symbol table and uses the
offsets generated by the previous pass and the pointers generated when
the symbol table was read in to create the structured hierarchy required
by coff.  It changes each pointer to a symbol into the index into the
symbol table of the asymbol.

   * 'coff_write_symbols'
   This routine runs through the symbol table and patches up the symbols
from their internal form into the coff way, calls the bit twiddlers, and
writes out the table to the file.

         union internal_auxent auxent;
         struct internal_syment syment;
       } u;

      bool is_sym;

         to provide extra information to their backend.  */
      void *extrap;
     } combined_entry_type;


     /* Each canonical asymbol really looks like this: */

     typedef struct coff_symbol_struct
     {
       /* The actual symbol which the rest of BFD works with */
       asymbol symbol;

3.3.2.8 Writing relocations
...........................

To write relocations, the back end steps though the canonical relocation
table and create an 'internal_reloc'.  The symbol index to use is
removed from the 'offset' field in the symbol table supplied.  The
address comes directly from the sum of the section base address and the
relocation offset; the type is dug directly from the howto field.  Then
the 'internal_reloc' is swapped into the shape of an 'external_reloc'
and written out to disk.

3.3.2.9 Reading linenumbers
...........................

Creating the linenumber table is done by reading in the entire coff
linenumber table, and creating another table for internal use.

   A coff linenumber table is structured so that each function is marked
as having a line number of 0.  Each line within the function is an
offset from the first line in the function.  The base of the line number
information for the table is stored in the symbol associated with the
function.

   Note: The PE format uses line number 0 for a flag indicating a new
source file.

   The information is copied from the external to the internal table,
and each symbol which marks a function is marked by pointing its...

   How does this work ?

3.3.2.10 Reading relocations
............................

Coff relocations are easily transformed into the internal BFD form
('arelent').

   Reading a coff relocation table is done in the following stages:

   * Read the entire coff relocation table into memory.

   * Process each relocation in turn; first swap it from the external to
     the internal form.

   * Turn the symbol referenced in the relocation's symbol index into a
     pointer into the canonical symbol table.  This table is the same as
     the one returned by a call to 'bfd_canonicalize_symtab'.  The back
     end will call that routine and save the result if a
     canonicalization hasn't been done.

   * The reloc index is turned into a pointer to a howto structure, in a
     back end specific way.  For instance, the 386 uses the 'r_type' to
     directly produce an index into a howto table vector.

3.4 ELF backends
================

BFD support for ELF formats is being worked on.  Currently, the best
supported back ends are for sparc and i386 (running svr4 or Solaris 2).

   Documentation of the internals of the support code still needs to be
written.  The code is changing quickly enough that we haven't bothered
yet.

3.5 mmo backend
===============

The mmo object format is used exclusively together with Professor Donald
E. Knuth's educational 64-bit processor MMIX. The simulator 'mmix' which
is available at <http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/src/index.html> understands this
format.  That package also includes a combined assembler and linker
called 'mmixal'.  The mmo format has no advantages feature-wise compared
to e.g.  ELF. It is a simple non-relocatable object format with no
support for archives or debugging information, except for symbol value
information and line numbers (which is not yet implemented in BFD). See
<http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/> for more information about MMIX. The ELF format
is used for intermediate object files in the BFD implementation.

File: bfd.info,  Node: File layout,  Next: Symbol-table,  Prev: mmo,  Up: mmo

3.5.1 File layout
-----------------

The mmo file contents is not partitioned into named sections as with
e.g. ELF. Memory areas is formed by specifying the location of the data
that follows.  Only the memory area '0x0000...00' to '0x01ff...ff' is
executable, so it is used for code (and constants) and the area
'0x2000...00' to '0x20ff...ff' is used for writable data.  *Note mmo
section mapping::.

   There is provision for specifying "special data" of 65536 different
types.  We use type 80 (decimal), arbitrarily chosen the same as the ELF
'e_machine' number for MMIX, filling it with section information
normally found in ELF objects.  *Note mmo section mapping::.

   Contents is entered as 32-bit words, xor:ed over previous contents,
always zero-initialized.  A word that starts with the byte '0x98' forms
a command called a 'lopcode', where the next byte distinguished between
the thirteen lopcodes.  The two remaining bytes, called the 'Y' and 'Z'
fields, or the 'YZ' field (a 16-bit big-endian number), are used for
various purposes different for each lopcode.  As documented in
<http://mmix.cs.hm.edu/doc/mmixal.pdf>, the lopcodes are:

'lop_quote'
     0x98000001.  The next word is contents, regardless of whether it
     starts with 0x98 or not.

'lop_loc'
     0x9801YYZZ, where 'Z' is 1 or 2.  This is a location directive,
     setting the location for the next data to the next 32-bit word (for
     Z = 1) or 64-bit word (for Z = 2), plus Y * 2^56.  Normally 'Y' is
     0 for the text segment and 2 for the data segment.  Beware that the
     low bits of non- tetrabyte-aligned values are silently discarded
     when being automatically incremented and when storing contents (in
     contrast to e.g.  its use as current location when followed by
     lop_fixo et al before the next possibly-quoted tetrabyte contents).

'lop_skip'
     0x9802YYZZ. Increase the current location by 'YZ' bytes.

'lop_fixo'
     0x9803YYZZ, where 'Z' is 1 or 2.  Store the current location as 64
     bits into the location pointed to by the next 32-bit (Z = 1) or
     64-bit (Z = 2) word, plus Y * 2^56.

'lop_fixr'
     0x9804YYZZ. 'YZ' is stored into the current location plus 2 - 4 *
     YZ.

'lop_fixrx'
     0x980500ZZ. 'Z' is 16 or 24.  A value 'L' derived from the
     following 32-bit word are used in a manner similar to 'YZ' in
     lop_fixr: it is xor:ed into the current location minus 4 * L.  The
     first byte of the word is 0 or 1.  If it is 1, then L = (LOWEST 24
     BITS OF WORD) - 2^Z, if 0, then L = (LOWEST 24 BITS OF WORD).

'lop_file'
     0x9806YYZZ. 'Y' is the file number, 'Z' is count of 32-bit words.
     Set the file number to 'Y' and the line counter to 0.  The next Z *
     4 bytes contain the file name, padded with zeros if the count is
     not a multiple of four.  The same 'Y' may occur multiple times, but
     'Z' must be 0 for all but the first occurrence.

'lop_line'
     0x9807YYZZ. 'YZ' is the line number.  Together with lop_file, it
     forms the source location for the next 32-bit word.  Note that for
     each non-lopcode 32-bit word, line numbers are assumed incremented
     by one.

'lop_spec'
     0x9808YYZZ. 'YZ' is the type number.  Data until the next lopcode
     other than lop_quote forms special data of type 'YZ'.  *Note mmo
     section mapping::.

     Other types than 80, (or type 80 with a content that does not
     parse) is stored in sections named '.MMIX.spec_data.N' where N is
     the 'YZ'-type.  The flags for such a sections say not to allocate
     or load the data.  The vma is 0.  Contents of multiple occurrences
     of special data N is concatenated to the data of the previous
     lop_spec Ns.  The location in data or code at which the lop_spec
     occurred is lost.

'lop_pre'
     0x980901ZZ. The first lopcode in a file.  The 'Z' field forms the
     length of header information in 32-bit words, where the first word
     tells the time in seconds since '00:00:00 GMT Jan 1 1970'.

'lop_post'
     0x980a00ZZ. Z > 32.  This lopcode follows after all
     content-generating lopcodes in a program.  The 'Z' field denotes
     the value of 'rG' at the beginning of the program.  The following
     256 - Z big-endian 64-bit words are loaded into global registers
     '$G' ... '$255'.

'lop_stab'
     0x980b0000.  The next-to-last lopcode in a program.  Must follow
     immediately after the lop_post lopcode and its data.  After this
     lopcode follows all symbols in a compressed format (*note
     Symbol-table::).

'lop_end'
     0x980cYYZZ. The last lopcode in a program.  It must follow the
     lop_stab lopcode and its data.  The 'YZ' field contains the number
     of 32-bit words of symbol table information after the preceding
     lop_stab lopcode.

   Note that the lopcode "fixups"; 'lop_fixr', 'lop_fixrx' and
'lop_fixo' are not generated by BFD, but are handled.  They are
generated by 'mmixal'.

   This trivial one-label, one-instruction file:

      :Main TRAP 1,2,3

   can be represented this way in mmo:

      0x98090101 - lop_pre, one 32-bit word with timestamp.
      <timestamp>
      0x98010002 - lop_loc, text segment, using a 64-bit address.
                   Note that mmixal does not emit this for the file above.
      0x00000000 - Address, high 32 bits.
      0x00000000 - Address, low 32 bits.
      0x98060002 - lop_file, 2 32-bit words for file-name.
      0x74657374 - "test"
      0x2e730000 - ".s\0\0"
      0x98070001 - lop_line, line 1.
      0x00010203 - TRAP 1,2,3
      0x980a00ff - lop_post, setting $255 to 0.
      0x00000000
      0x00000000
      0x980b0000 - lop_stab for ":Main" = 0, serial 1.
      0x203a4040   *Note Symbol-table::.
      0x10404020
      0x4d206120
      0x69016e00

3.5.2 Symbol table format
-------------------------

From mmixal.w (or really, the generated mmixal.tex) in the MMIXware
package which also contains the 'mmix' simulator: "Symbols are stored
and retrieved by means of a 'ternary search trie', following ideas of
Bentley and Sedgewick.  (See ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms '8'
(1997), 360-369; R.Sedgewick, 'Algorithms in C' (Reading, Mass.
Addison-Wesley, 1998), '15.4'.)  Each trie node stores a character, and
there are branches to subtries for the cases where a given character is
less than, equal to, or greater than the character in the trie.  There
also is a pointer to a symbol table entry if a symbol ends at the
current node."

   So it's a tree encoded as a stream of bytes.  The stream of bytes
acts on a single virtual global symbol, adding and removing characters
and signalling complete symbol points.  Here, we read the stream and
create symbols at the completion points.

   First, there's a control byte 'm'.  If any of the listed bits in 'm'
is nonzero, we execute what stands at the right, in the listed order:

      (MMO3_LEFT)
      0x40 - Traverse left trie.
             (Read a new command byte and recurse.)

      (MMO3_SYMBITS)
      0x2f - Read the next byte as a character and store it in the
             current character position; increment character position.
             Test the bits of m:

             (MMO3_WCHAR)
             0x80 - The character is 16-bit (so read another byte,
                    merge into current character.

             (MMO3_TYPEBITS)
             0xf  - We have a complete symbol; parse the type, value
                    and serial number and do what should be done
                    with a symbol.  The type and length information
                    is in j = (m & 0xf).

                    (MMO3_REGQUAL_BITS)
                    j == 0xf: A register variable.  The following
                              byte tells which register.
                    j <= 8:   An absolute symbol.  Read j bytes as the
                              big-endian number the symbol equals.
                              A j = 2 with two zero bytes denotes an
                              unknown symbol.
                    j > 8:    As with j <= 8, but add (0x20 << 56)
                              to the value in the following j - 8
                              bytes.

                    Then comes the serial number, as a variant of
                    uleb128, but better named ubeb128:
                    Read bytes and shift the previous value left 7
                    (multiply by 128).  Add in the new byte, repeat
                    until a byte has bit 7 set.  The serial number
                    is the computed value minus 128.

             (MMO3_MIDDLE)
             0x20 - Traverse middle trie.  (Read a new command byte
                    and recurse.)  Decrement character position.

      (MMO3_RIGHT)
      0x10 - Traverse right trie.  (Read a new command byte and
             recurse.)

   Let's look again at the 'lop_stab' for the trivial file (*note File
layout::).

      0x980b0000 - lop_stab for ":Main" = 0, serial 1.
      0x203a4040
      0x10404020
      0x4d206120
      0x69016e00
      0x81000000

   This forms the trivial trie (note that the path between ":" and "M"
is redundant):

      203a     ":"
      40       /
      40      /
      10      \
      40      /
      40     /
      204d  "M"
      2061  "a"
      2069  "i"
      016e  "n" is the last character in a full symbol, and
            with a value represented in one byte.
      00    The value is 0.
      81    The serial number is 1.

3.5.3 mmo section mapping
-------------------------

The implementation in BFD uses special data type 80 (decimal) to
encapsulate and describe named sections, containing e.g. debug
information.  If needed, any datum in the encapsulation will be quoted
using lop_quote.  First comes a 32-bit word holding the number of 32-bit
words containing the zero-terminated zero-padded segment name.  After
the name there's a 32-bit word holding flags describing the section
type.  Then comes a 64-bit big-endian word with the section length (in
bytes), then another with the section start address.  Depending on the
type of section, the contents might follow, zero-padded to 32-bit
boundary.  For a loadable section (such as data or code), the contents
might follow at some later point, not necessarily immediately, as a
lop_loc with the same start address as in the section description,
followed by the contents.  This in effect forms a descriptor that must
be emitted before the actual contents.  Sections described this way must
not overlap.

   For areas that don't have such descriptors, synthetic sections are
formed by BFD. Consecutive contents in the two memory areas
'0x0000...00' to '0x01ff...ff' and '0x2000...00' to '0x20ff...ff' are
entered in sections named '.text' and '.data' respectively.  If an area
is not otherwise described, but would together with a neighboring lower
area be less than '0x40000000' bytes long, it is joined with the lower
area and the gap is zero-filled.  For other cases, a new section is
formed, named '.MMIX.sec.N'.  Here, N is a number, a running count
through the mmo file, starting at 0.

   A loadable section specified as:

      .section secname,"ax"
      TETRA 1,2,3,4,-1,-2009
      BYTE 80

   and linked to address '0x4', is represented by the sequence:

      0x98080050 - lop_spec 80
      0x00000002 - two 32-bit words for the section name
      0x7365636e - "secn"
      0x616d6500 - "ame\0"
      0x00000033 - flags CODE, READONLY, LOAD, ALLOC
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section length
      0x0000001c - section length is 28 bytes; 6 * 4 + 1 + alignment to 32 bits
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section address
      0x00000004 - section address is 4
      0x98010002 - 64 bits with address of following data
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of address
      0x00000004 - low 32 bits: data starts at address 4
      0x00000001 - 1
      0x00000002 - 2
      0x00000003 - 3
      0x00000004 - 4
      0xffffffff - -1
      0xfffff827 - -2009
      0x50000000 - 80 as a byte, padded with zeros.

   Note that the lop_spec wrapping does not include the section
contents.  Compare this to a non-loaded section specified as:

      .section thirdsec
      TETRA 200001,100002
      BYTE 38,40

   This, when linked to address '0x200000000000001c', is represented by:

      0x98080050 - lop_spec 80
      0x00000002 - two 32-bit words for the section name
      0x7365636e - "thir"
      0x616d6500 - "dsec"
      0x00000010 - flag READONLY
      0x00000000 - high 32 bits of section length
      0x0000000c - section length is 12 bytes; 2 * 4 + 2 + alignment to 32 bits
      0x20000000 - high 32 bits of address
      0x0000001c - low 32 bits of address 0x200000000000001c
      0x00030d41 - 200001
      0x000186a2 - 100002
      0x26280000 - 38, 40 as bytes, padded with zeros

   For the latter example, the section contents must not be loaded in
memory, and is therefore specified as part of the special data.  The
address is usually unimportant but might provide information for e.g.
the DWARF 2 debugging format.

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
