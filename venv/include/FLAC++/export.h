 *  This module contains \#defines and symbols for exporting function
 *  calls, and providing version information and compiled-in features.
 *
 *  If you are compiling for Windows (with Visual Studio or MinGW for
 *  example) and will link to the static library (libFLAC++.lib) you
 *  should define FLAC__NO_DLL in your project to make sure the symbols
 *  are exported properly.

/** This \#define is used internally in libFLAC and its headers to make
 * sure the correct symbols are exported when working with shared
 * libraries. On Windows, this \#define is set to __declspec(dllexport)
 * when compiling libFLAC into a library and to __declspec(dllimport)
 * when the headers are used to link to that DLL. On non-Windows systems
 * it is used to set symbol visibility.
 *
 * Because of this, the define FLAC__NO_DLL must be defined when linking
 * to libFLAC statically or linking will fail.
 */
/* This has grown quite complicated. FLAC__NO_DLL is used by MSVC sln
 * files and CMake, which build either static or shared. autotools can
 * build static, shared or **both**. Therefore, DLL_EXPORT, which is set
 * by libtool, must override FLAC__NO_DLL on building shared components
