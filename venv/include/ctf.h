/* CTF - Compact ANSI-C Type Format

   This file format can be used to compactly represent the information needed
   by a debugger to interpret the ANSI-C types used by a given program.
   Traditionally, this kind of information is generated by the compiler when
   invoked with the -g flag and is stored in "stabs" strings or in the more
   modern DWARF format.  CTF provides a representation of only the information
   that is relevant to debugging a complex, optimized C program such as the
   operating system kernel in a form that is significantly more compact than
   the equivalent stabs or DWARF representation.  The format is data-model
   independent, so consumers do not need different code depending on whether
   they are 32-bit or 64-bit programs; libctf automatically compensates for
   endianness variations.  CTF assumes that a standard ELF symbol table is
   available for use in the debugger, and uses the structure and data of the
   symbol table to avoid storing redundant information.  The CTF data may be
   compressed on disk or in memory, indicated by a bit in the header.  CTF may
   be interpreted in a raw disk file, or it may be stored in an ELF section,
   typically named .ctf.  Data structures are aligned so that a raw CTF file or
   CTF ELF section may be manipulated using mmap(2).

   The CTF file or section itself has the following structure:

   +--------+--------+---------+----------+--------+----------+...
   |  file  |  type  |  data   | function | object | function |...
   | header | labels | objects |   info   | index  |  index   |...
   +--------+--------+---------+----------+--------+----------+...

   ...+----------+-------+--------+
   ...| variable | data  | string |
   ...|   info   | types | table  |
      +----------+-------+--------+

   The file header stores a magic number and version information, encoding
   flags, and the byte offset of each of the sections relative to the end of the
   header itself.  If the CTF data has been uniquified against another set of
   CTF data, a reference to that data also appears in the the header.  This
   reference is the name of the label corresponding to the types uniquified
   against.

   Following the header is a list of labels, used to group the types included in
   the data types section.  Each label is accompanied by a type ID i.  A given
   label refers to the group of types whose IDs are in the range [0, i].

   Data object and function records (collectively, "symtypetabs") are stored in
   the same order as they appear in the corresponding symbol table, except that
   symbols marked SHN_UNDEF are not stored and symbols that have no type data
   are padded out with zeroes.  For each entry in these tables, the type ID (a
   small integer) is recorded.  (Functions get CTF_K_FUNCTION types, just like
   data objects that are function pointers.)

   For situations in which the order of the symbols in the symtab is not known,
   or most symbols have no type in this dict and most entries would be
   zero-pads, a pair of optional indexes follow the data object and function
   info sections: each of these is an array of strtab indexes, mapped 1:1 to the
   corresponding data object / function info section, giving each entry in those
   sections a name so that the linker can correlate them with final symtab
   entries and reorder them accordingly (dropping the indexes in the process).

   Variable records (as distinct from data objects) provide a modicum of support
   for non-ELF systems, mapping a variable or function name to a CTF type ID.
   The names are sorted into ASCIIbetical order, permitting binary searching.
   We do not define how the consumer maps these variable names to addresses or
   anything else, or indeed what these names represent: they might be names
   looked up at runtime via dlsym() or names extracted at runtime by a debugger
   or anything else the consumer likes.  Variable records with identically-
   named entries in the data object or function index section are removed.

   The data types section is a list of variable size records that represent each
   type, in order by their ID.  The types themselves form a directed graph,
   where each node may contain one or more outgoing edges to other type nodes,
   denoted by their ID.  Most type nodes are standalone or point backwards to
   earlier nodes, but this is not required: nodes can point to later nodes,
   particularly structure and union members.

   Strings are recorded as a string table ID (0 or 1) and a byte offset into the
   string table.  String table 0 is the internal CTF string table.  String table
   1 is the external string table, which is the string table associated with the
   ELF dynamic symbol table for this object.  CTF does not record any strings
   that are already in the symbol table, and the CTF string table does not
   contain any duplicated strings.

   If the CTF data has been merged with another parent CTF object, some outgoing
   edges may refer to type nodes that exist in another CTF object.  The debugger
   and libctf library are responsible for connecting the appropriate objects
   together so that the full set of types can be explored and manipulated.

   This connection is done purely using the ctf_import() function.  The
   ctf_archive machinery (and thus ctf_open et al) automatically imports archive
   members named ".ctf" into child dicts if available in the same archive, to
   match the relationship set up by the linker, but callers can call ctf_import
   themselves as well if need be, if they know a different relationship is in
   force.  */
