#   -fontconfig -system-freetype \
#   -xcb -no-opengl

# Ensure that pkg-config is properly configured, or that
#   PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/share/pkgconfig
# is set in your build environment.
#
# If you don't want to use pkg-config, you can add:
#   -L/opt/X11/lib -I/opt/X11/include
# to the configure options.
#
# Due to irreconcilable differences between Cocoa
# and X11, OpenGL is currently not supported.
