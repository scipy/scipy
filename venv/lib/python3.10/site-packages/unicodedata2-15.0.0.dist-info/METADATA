Testing
=======

We run the tests using `tox`. This can be installed as usual with `pip install tox`.

Without any options, `tox` will run the tests against all of the library's
target Python versions. Any missing versions will be skipped.

To run tests against a specific python version you can use the `-e` option followed by
a tox environment name. E.g. `-e py38` will run tests against Python 3.8.
For more info, check `tox`'s [documentation](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
