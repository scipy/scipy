def anova(data, effects=['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K']):
    """
Prints the results of single-variable between- and within-subject ANOVA
designs.  The function can only handle univariate ANOVAs with a single
random factor.  The random factor is coded in column 0 of the input
list/array (see below) and the measured variable is coded in the last
column of the input list/array. The following were used as references
when writing the code:

Maxwell, SE, Delaney HD (1990)  Designing Experiments and Analyzing
    Data, Wadsworth: Belmont, CA.
Lindman, HR (1992) Analysis of Variance in Experimental Design,
    Springer-Verlag: New York.

TO DO:  Increase Current Max Of 10 Levels Per W/I-Subject Factor
        Consolidate Between-Subj Analyses For Between And Within/Between
        Front-end for different input data-array shapes/organization
        Axe mess of 'global' statements (particularly for d_restrict fcns)

Usage:   anova(data,                         data = |Stat format
               effects=['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K'])

Note: |Stat format is as follows ... one datum per row, first element of
row is the subject identifier, followed by all within/between subject
variable designators, and the measured data point as the last element in the
row.  Thus, [1, 'short', 'drugY', 2, 14.7] represents subject 1 when measured
in the short / drugY / 2 condition, and subject 1 gave a measured value of
14.7 in this combination of conditions.  Thus, all input lists are '2D'
lists-of-lists.
