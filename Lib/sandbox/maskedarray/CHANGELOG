    The maskedarray package went through some major updates recently. 
Originally, a MaskedArray object had two major attributes: (i) _data, a
(subclass of) ndarray that stored the values, and (ii) _mask, a ndarray of
booleans storing whether the values were masekd or not. This structure was
directly derived from the original implementation of MaskedArray, available in
numpy.core.ma.

However, this approach wasn't very natural. For example, in order to access the
data of a MaskedArray instance, one had to query the _data attribute instead of
the instance itself. In addition, the previous implementation of MaskedArray as
a subclass of ndarray presented some problems. Thus, most of the attributes of
a MaskedArray object were defined as class defaults, which turned out to be
thread-unsafe. Moreover, subclassing MaskedArray wasn't straightforward, when
the subclass introduced new parameters in its __new__ method.

The current implementation tries to alleviate these problems. The most
significant difference is that the _data attribute is now a view of the array
as a (subclass of) ndarray. The actual type is set by the _baseclass attribute,
defined at the creation of a new masked array as the class of the underlying
data. Thus, it is still possible to use a matrix object as the underlying data:
the new masked array will then use the matrix  methods. Note that if the
underlying data has its own attributes, these latter are not propagated to the
MaskedArray instance, but are reinitialized at each access. In other terms, you
will lose specific values of these attributes during processing. You should
then consider defining a subclass of MaskedArray. Note also that because the
_data attribute is a view, any attempt to directly set it will likely fail. For
example, x._data = 5 will raise an AttributeError exception. You should then
use x._data[:] = 5 instead).

The _mask attibute is left unchanged. Because it is a basic attribute, it can
be overwritten far too easily. If you want to specify a new value for the mask,
you should use the _setmask or __setmask__ methods: these methods ensure that
the new mask has the same shape as the data, and that the _hardmask condition
is respected.

Following the suggestions of Reggie Dugard, the class defaults have been
suppressed. Unfortunately, that required to add some extra definitions in the
__array_finalize__ method, which tends to have a slight negative impact on
performances. Moreover, most methods now return a view of the masked array
instead of creating a new masked array from scratch.


The previous implementation of MaskedArray is called core_ini.py and it can be
found in the alternative_versions directory. This folder contains also yet
another implementation core_alt. This latter is left for documentation purposes,
and should serve as a template when we'll port the package to C.
