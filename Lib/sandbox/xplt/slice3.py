 # Caveats:
 # (A) Performance is reasonably good, but may still be a factor of
 #     several slower than what could be achieved in compiled code.
 # (B) Only a simple in-memory mesh model is implemented here.
 #     However, hooks are supplied for more interesting possibilities,
 #     such as a large binary file resident mesh data base.
 # (C) There is a conceptual difficulty with _walk3 for the case
 #     of a quad face all four of whose edges are cut by the slicing
 #     plane.  This can only happen when two opposite corners are
 #     above and the other two below the slicing plane.  There are
 #     three possible ways to connect the four intersection points in
 #     two pairs: (1) // (2) \\ and (3) X  There is a severe problem
 #     with (1) and (2) in that a consistent decision must be made
 #     when connecting the points on the two cells which share the
 #     face - that is, each face must carry information on which way
 #     it is triangulated.  For a regular 3D mesh, it is relatively
 #     easy to come up with a consistent scheme for triangulating faces,
 #     but for a general unstructured mesh, each face itself must carry
 #     this information.  This presents a huge challenge for data flow,
 #     which I don't believe is worthwhile.  Because the X choice is
 #     unique, and I don't see why we shouldn't use it here.
 #     For contouring routines, we reject the X choice on esthetic
 #     grounds, and perhaps that will prove to be the case here as
 #     well - but I believe we should try the simple way out first.
 #     In this case, we are going to be filling these polygons with
 #     a color representing a function value in the cell.  Since the
 #     adjacent cells should have nearly the same values, the X-traced
 #     polygons will have nearly the same color, and I doubt there will
 #     be an esthetic problem.  Anyway, the slice3 implemented
 #     below produces the unique X (bowtied) polygons, rather than
 #     attempting to choose between // or \\ (non-bowtied) alternatives.
 #     Besides, in the case of contours, the trivial alternating
 #     triangulation scheme is just as bad esthetically as every
 #     zone triangulated the same way!

      make mesh3 argument for slice3, xyz3, getv3, etc., functions.
      X, Y, and Z are each 3D coordinate arrays.  The optional F1, F2,
      etc. are 3D arrays of function values (e.g. density, temperature)
      which have one less value along each dimension than the coordinate
      arrays.  The "index" of each zone in the returned mesh3 is
      the index in these cell-centered Fi arrays, so every index from
      one through the total number of cells indicates one real cell.
      The Fi arrays can also have the same dimensions as X, Y, or Z
      in order to represent point-centered quantities.

      If X has four dimensions and the length of the first is 3, then
      it is interpreted as XYZ (which is the quantity actually stored
      in the returned cell list).

      If X is a vector of 3 integers, it is interpreted as [nx,ny,nz]
      of a uniform 3D mesh, and the second and third arguments are
      [dx,dy,dz] and [x0,y0,z0] respectively.  (DXDYDZ represent the
      size of the entire mesh, not the size of one cell, and NXNYNZ are
      the number of cells, not the number of points.)

      Added by ZCM 1/13/97: if x, y, and z are one-dimensional of
      the same length and if the keyword verts exists and yields
      an NCELLS by 8 integer array, then we have an unstructured
      rectangular mesh, and the subscripts of cell i's vertices
      are verts[i, 0:8].

      Added by ZCM 10/10/97: if x, y, and z are one-dimensional
      of the same length or not, and verts does not exist, then
      we have a structured reectangular mesh with unequally spaced
      nodes.

      Other sorts of meshes are possible -- a mesh which lives
      in a binary file is an obvious example -- which would need
      different workers for xyz3, getv3, getc3, and iterator3
      iterator3_rect may be more general than the other three;
      as long as the cell dimensions are the car of the list
      which is the 2nd car of m3, it will work.

 # Ways that a list of polygons can be extracted:
 # Basic idea:
 #   (1) At each *vertex* of the cell list, a function value is defined.
 #       This is the "slicing function", perhaps the equation of a plane,
 #       perhaps some other vertex-centered function.
 #   (2) The slice3 routine returns a list of cells for which the
 #       function value changes sign -- that is, cells for which some
 #       vertices have positive function values, and some negative.
 #       The function values and vertex coordinates are also returned.
 #   (3) The slice3 routine computes the points along the *edges*
 #       of each cell where the function value is zero (assuming linear
 #       variation along each edge).  These points will be vertices of
 #       the polygons.  The routine also sorts the vertices into cyclic
 #       order.
 #   (4) A "color function" can be used to assign a "color" or other
 #       value to each polygon.  If this function depends only on the
 #       coordinates of the polygon vertices (e.g.- 3D lighting), then
 #       the calculation can be done elsewhere.  There are two other
 #       possibilities:  The color function might be a cell-centered
 #       quantity, or a vertex-centered quantity (like the slicing
 #       function) on the mesh.  In these cases, slice3 already
 #       has done much of the work, since it "knows" cell indices,
 #       edge interpolation coefficients, and the like.
 #
 # There are two particularly important cases:
 # (1) Slicing function is a plane, coloring function is either a
 #     vertex or cell centered mesh function.  Coloring function
 #     might also be a *function* of one or more of the predefined
 #     mesh functions.  If you're eventually going to sweep the whole
 #     mesh, you want to precalculate it, otherwise on-the-fly might
 #     be better.
 # (2) Slicing function is a vertex centered mesh function,
 #     coloring function is 3D shading (deferred).
 #
 # fslice(m3, vertex_list)
 # vertex_list_iterator(m3, vertex_list, mesh3)
 # fcolor(m3, vertex_list, fslice_1, fslice_2)
 #   the coloring function may need the value of fslice at the vertices
 #   in order to compute the color values by interpolation
 # two "edge functions": one to detect edges where sign of fslice changes,
 #   second to interpolate for fcolor
 #   second to interpolate for fcolor
 #
 # slice3(m3, fslice, &nverts, &xyzverts, <fcolor>)

def slice3 (m3, fslice, nverts, xyzverts, * args, ** kw) :

    """
    slice3 (m3, fslice, nverts, xyzverts)
          or color_values= slice3(m3, fslice, nverts, xyzverts, fcolor)
          or color_values= slice3(m3, fslice, nverts, xyzverts, fcolor, 1)

      slice the 3D mesh M3 using the slicing function FSLICE, returning
      the list [NVERTS, XYZVERTS, color].  Note that it is impossible to
      pass arguments as addresses, as yorick does in this routine.
      NVERTS is the number of vertices in each polygon of the slice, and
      XYZVERTS is the 3-by-sum(NVERTS) list of polygon vertices.  If the
      FCOLOR argument is present, the values of that coloring function on
      the polygons are returned as the value of the slice3 function
      (numberof(color_values) == numberof(NVERTS) == number of polygons).

      If the slice function FSLICE is a function, it should be of the
      form:
         func fslice(m3, chunk)
      returning a list of function values on the specified chunk of the
      mesh m3.  The format of chunk depends on the type of m3 mesh, so
      you should use only the other mesh functions xyz3 and getv3 which
      take m3 and chunk as arguments.  The return value of fslice should
      have the same dimensions as the return value of getv3; the return
      value of xyz3 has an additional first dimension of length 3.

      If FSLICE is a list of 4 numbers, it is taken as a slicing plane
      with the equation FSLICE(+:1:3)*xyz(+)-FSLICE(4), as returned by
      plane3.

      If FSLICE is a single integer, the slice will be an isosurface for
      the FSLICEth variable associated with the mesh M3.  In this case,
      the keyword value= must also be present, representing the value
      of that variable on the isosurface.

      If FCOLOR is nil, slice3 returns nil.  If you want to color the
      polygons in a manner that depends only on their vertex coordinates
      (e.g.- by a 3D shading calculation), use this mode.

      If FCOLOR is a function, it should be of the form:
         func fcolor(m3, cells, l, u, fsl, fsu, ihist)
      returning a list of function values on the specified cells of the
      mesh m3.  The cells argument will be the list of cell indices in
      m3 at which values are to be returned.  l, u, fsl, fsu, and ihist
      are interpolation coefficients which can be used to interpolate
      from vertex centered values to the required cell centered values,
      ignoring the cells argument.  See getc3 source code.
      The return values should always have dimsof(cells).

      If FCOLOR is a single integer, the slice will be an isosurface for
      the FCOLORth variable associated with the mesh M3.

      If the optional argument after FCOLOR is non-nil and non-zero,
      then the FCOLOR function is called with only two arguments:
         func fcolor(m3, cells)

      The keyword argument NODE, if present and nonzero, is a signal
      to return node-centered values rather than cell-centered
      values. (ZCM 4/16/97)

def slice3mesh (xyz, * args, ** kw) :

    """
    slice3mesh returns a triple [nverts, xyzverts, color]
     nverts is no_cells long and the ith entry tells how many
        vertices the ith cell has.
     xyzverts is sum (nverts) by 3 and gives the vertex
        coordinates of the cells in order.
     color, if present, is len (nverts) long and contains
        a color value for each cell in the mesh.

    There are a number of ways to call slice3mesh:

       slice3mesh (z, color = None)

    z is a two dimensional array of cell function values, assumed
       to be on a uniform mesh nx by ny cells (assuming z is nx by ny)
       nx being the number of cells in the x direction, ny the number
       in the y direction.
    color, if specified, is either an nx by ny array
       of cell-centered values by which the surface is to
       be colored, or an nx +1 by ny + 1 array of vertex-
       centered values, which will be averaged over each
       cell to give cell-centered values.

       slice3mesh (nxny, dxdy, x0y0, z, color = None)

    In this case, slice3mesh accepts the specification for
    a regular 2d mesh: nxny is the number of cells in the
    x direction and the y direction; x0y0 are the initial
    values of x and y; and dxdy are the increments in the
    two directions. z is the height of a surface above
    the xy plane and must be dimensioned nx + 1 by ny + 1.
    color, if specified, is as above.

       slice3mesh (x, y, z, color = None)

    z is as above, an nx by ny array of function values
    on a mesh of the same dimensions. There are two choices
    for x and y: they can both be one-dimensional, dimensioned
    nx and ny respectively, in which case they represent a
    mesh whose edges are parallel to the axes; or else they
    can both be nx by ny, in which case they represent a
    general quadrilateral mesh.
    color, if specified, is as above.

    pl3tree (nverts, xyzverts = None, values = None, plane = None,
       cmin = None, cmax = None)

      Add the polygon list specified by NVERTS (number of vertices in
      each polygon) and XYZVERTS (3-by-sum(NVERTS) vertex coordinates)
      to the currently displayed b-tree.  If VALUES is specified, it
      must have the same dimension as NVERTS, and represents the color
      of each polygon.  If VALUES is not specified, the polygons
      are assumed to form an isosurface which will be shaded by the
      current 3D lighting model; the isosurfaces are at the leaves of
      the b-tree, sliced by all of the planes.  If PLANE is specified,
      the XYZVERTS must all lie in that plane, and that plane becomes
      a new slicing plane in the b-tree.

      Each leaf of the b-tree consists of a set of sliced isosurfaces.
      A node of the b-tree consists of some polygons in one of the
      planes, a b-tree or leaf entirely on one side of that plane, and
      a b-tree or leaf on the other side.  The first plane you add
      becomes the root node, slicing any existing leaf in half.  When
      you add an isosurface, it propagates down the tree, getting
      sliced at each node, until its pieces reach the existing leaves,
      to which they are added.  When you add a plane, it also propagates
      down the tree, getting sliced at each node, until its pieces
      reach the leaves, which it slices, becoming the nodes closest to
      the leaves.

      tree is a 4-element list like this:
       [plane, back_tree, inplane_leaf, front_tree]
       plane= tree [0]  is None if this is just a leaf
                        in which case, only inplane_leaf is not None
       back_tree= tree [1]    is the part behind plane
       inplane_leaf= tree [2] is the part in the plane itself
       front_tree= tree [3]   is the part in front of plane

      This structure is relatively easy to plot, since from any
      viewpoint, a node can always be plotted in the order from one
      side, then the plane, then the other side.

      This routine assumes a "split palette"; the colors for the
      VALUES will be scaled to fit from color 0 to color 99, while
      the colors from the shading calculation will be scaled to fit
      from color 100 to color 199.  (If VALUES is specified as a char
      array, however, it will be used without scaling.)
      You may specifiy a cmin= or cmax= keyword to affect the
      scaling; cmin is ignored if VALUES is not specified (use the
      ambient= keyword from light3 for that case).
    """

#    (ZCM 4/23/97) Add the split keyword. This will determine
#    whether or not to split the palette (half to the isosurfaces
#    for shading and the other half to plane sections for contouring).

#    (ZCM 7/17/97) Add a calculation of the maximum and minimum
#    of everything that is put into the tree. This cures distortion
#    caused by loss of accuracy in orientation calculations.
#    What is now put on the display list is pl3tree and [tree, minmax];

    to_corners3(list, nj, nk)
      convert an array of cell indices in an (ni-1)-by-(NJ-1)-by-(NK-1)
      logically rectangular grid of cells into the list of
      len(LIST)-by-2-by-2-by-2 cell corner indices in the
      corresponding ni-by-NJ-by-NK array of vertices.
      Note that this computation in Yorick gives an absolute offset
      for each cell quantity in the grid. In Yorick it is legal to
      index a multidimensional array with an absolute offset. In
      Python it is not. However, an array can be flattened if
      necessary.
      Other changes from Yorick were necessitated by row-major
      order and 0-origin indices, and of course the lack of
      Yorick array facilities.
