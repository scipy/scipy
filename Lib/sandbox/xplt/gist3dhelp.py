     runs a movie based on the given DRAW_FRAME function.  The movie
     stops after a total elapsed time of TIME_LIMIT seconds, which
     defaults to 60 (one minute), or when the DRAW_FRAME function
     returns zero.

     note: All but the first argument are keyword arguments, with

     If MIN_INTERFRAME is specified, a pause will be added as
     necessary to slow down the movie.  MIN_INTERFRAME is a time

     The keyword bracket_time= (again a time in seconds) can be
     used to adjust the duration of the pauses after the first
     and last frames.  It may also be a two element array [beg, end].
     If the pause at the end is greater than five seconds, you will
     be prompted to explain that hitting <RETURN> will abort the final
     pause. Well, the Python version does not have this capability.

     timing = 1 enables a timing printout for your movie.

     If every frame of your movie has the same limits, use the
     limits command to fix the limits before you call movie.

   BUG:  If you hit <RETURN> to start a movie early, it will not
         pause at the end of the movie at all.  You probably should
         not use long initial pauses.

   General overview of module pl3d:

   (1) Viewing transform machinery.  Arguably the simplest model
       is the CAD/CAM notion that the object you see is oriented
       as you see it in the current picture.  You can then move
       it left, right, up, down, or toward or away from you,
       or you can rotate it about any of the three axes (horizontal,
       vertical, or out of the screen).  The xyz coordinates of the
       object remains unchanged throughout all of this, but this
       object coordinate system changes relative to the fixed
       xyz of the viewer, in which x is always to the right, y is
       up, and z is directed out of the screen.  Initially, the
       two coordinate systems coincide.

       rot3 (xangle,yangle,zangle)
         Rotate the object about viewer's x-axis by xangle, then
         about viewer's y-axis by yangle, then about viewer's
         z-axis by zangle
       mov3 (xchange,ychange,zchange)
         Move the object by the specified amounts.

       setz3 (zcamera)
         The "camera" is located at (0,0,zcamera) in the viewer's
         coordinate system, looking in the minus-z direction.
         Initially, zcamera is very large, and the magnification
         factor is correspondingly large, giving an isometric view.
         Decreasing zcamera makes the perspective more extreme.
         If parts of the object are behind the camera, strange things
         may happen.

     The ambient level A_LEVEL is a light level (arbitrary units)
     that is added to every surface independent of its orientation.

     The diffuse level D_LEVEL is a light level which is proportional
     to cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the surface
     normal and the viewing direction, so that surfaces directly
     facing the viewer are bright, while surfaces viewed edge on are
     unlit (and surfaces facing away, if drawn, are shaded as if they
     faced the viewer).

     The specular level S_LEVEL is a light level proportional to a high
     power spower=N of 1+cos(alpha), where alpha is the angle between
     the specular reflection angle and the viewing direction.  The light
     source for the calculation of alpha lies in the direction XYZ (a
     3 element vector) in the viewer's coordinate system at infinite
     distance.  You can have ns light sources by making S_LEVEL, N, and
     XYZ (or any combination) be vectors of length ns (3-by-ns in the
     case of XYZ).  (See source code for specular_hook function
     definition if powers of 1+cos(alpha) aren't good enough for you.)

     slice the 3D mesh M3 using the slicing function FSLICE, returning
     the list [NVERTS, XYZVERTS, color].  Note that it is impossible to
     pass arguments as addresses, as yorick does in this routine.
     NVERTS is the number of vertices in each polygon of the slice, and
     XYZVERTS is the 3-by-sum(NVERTS) list of polygon vertices.  If the
     FCOLOR argument is present, the values of that coloring function on
     the polygons are returned as the value of the slice3 function
     (numberof(color_values) == numberof(NVERTS) == number of polygons).

     If the slice function FSLICE is a function, it should be of the
     form:
        func fslice(m3, chunk)
     returning a list of function values on the specified chunk of the
     mesh m3.  The format of chunk depends on the type of m3 mesh, so
     you should use only the other mesh functions xyz3 and getv3 which
     take m3 and chunk as arguments.  The return value of fslice should
     have the same dimensions as the return value of getv3; the return
     value of xyz3 has an additional first dimension of length 3.

     If FSLICE is a list of 4 numbers, it is taken as a slicing plane
     with the equation FSLICE(+:1:3)*xyz(+)-FSLICE(4), as returned by
     plane3.

     If FSLICE is a single integer, the slice will be an isosurface for
     the FSLICEth variable associated with the mesh M3.  In this case,
     the keyword value= must also be present, representing the value
     of that variable on the isosurface.

     If FCOLOR is nil, slice3 returns nil.  If you want to color the
     polygons in a manner that depends only on their vertex coordinates
     (e.g.- by a 3D shading calculation), use this mode.

     If FCOLOR is a function, it should be of the form:
        func fcolor(m3, cells, l, u, fsl, fsu, ihist)
     returning a list of function values on the specified cells of the
     mesh m3.  The cells argument will be the list of cell indices in
     m3 at which values are to be returned.  l, u, fsl, fsu, and ihist
     are interpolation coefficients which can be used to interpolate
     from vertex centered values to the required cell centered values,
     ignoring the cells argument.  See getc3 source code.
     The return values should always have dimsof(cells).

     If FCOLOR is a single integer, the slice will be an isosurface for
     the FCOLORth variable associated with the mesh M3.

     If the optional argument after FCOLOR is non-nil and non-zero,

       coordinates of the cells in order.
    color, if present, is len (nverts) long and contains

   z is a two dimensional array of cell function values, assumed

      in the y direction.

      of cell-centered values by which the surface is to
      be colored, or an nx +1 by ny + 1 array of vertex-
      centered values, which will be averaged over each
      cell to give cell-centered values.

      slice3mesh (nxny, dxdy, x0y0, z, color = None)

   In this case, slice3mesh accepts the specification for
   a regular 2d mesh: nxny is the number of cells in the
   x direction and the y direction; x0y0 are the initial
   values of x and y; and dxdy are the increments in the
   two directions. z is the height of a surface above
   the xy plane and must be dimensioned nx + 1 by ny + 1.
   color, if specified, is as above.

      slice3mesh (x, y, z, color = None)

   z is as above, an nx by ny array of function values
   on a mesh of the same dimensions. There are two choices
   for x and y: they can both be one-dimensional, dimensioned
   nx and ny respectively, in which case they represent a
   mesh whose edges are parallel to the axes; or else they
   can both be nx by ny, in which case they represent a
   general quadrilateral mesh.
