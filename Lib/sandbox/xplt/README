This is a modification of the pygist package to work with SciPy

It combines the gist and play subroutines of yorick 

with the gistCmodule.c of pygist

and uses some of the setup.py information from pygist as well.


The python files were taken from scipy/xplt which were modified from

and original LLNLDistribution12beta of Gist

Several Python files and *.gp and *.gs files are original from scipy
