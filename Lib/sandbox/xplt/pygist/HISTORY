        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Correct mouse return; see MouseCallBack.
            *** Problem reported by Dave Grote.  the MouseCallBack
                calls of PyGist agree with those with Yorick-1.5
                both in number of calls and arguments.  There is no
                mouseError setting in Yorick; removing these in 
                MouseCallBack causes things to return properly.
                However, Yorick-1.5 has more logic in this area.
                Do not implement additional code for now.

V030213 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Add plremove implementation contributed by
            Dave P. Grote (LBNL).
            Add his fix to pli (interchange iMax and jMax).

V030117 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c: Remove remaining warnings with gcc 2.96 by:
            - Reduce to one dummy for file
            - Remove dumpFreeList, Add1 cumsum, equal, greater, 
              greater_equal, less, logical_and, not_equal, 
              WeightedHist if not INCLUDE_EXTRA_GISTCODE.

        *** Tested compilation with gcc 3.2.1 (latest I could get hold of).

V030113 Michiel de Hoon 

        1.  gistCmodule.c:   Add back on omitted bug fix for Windows 
            (wait_for_expose).  Unix/Linux version is unaffected.

V021227 Michiel de Hoon 

        1.  play/unix/config.sh:  Add fputest.

        2.  play/win/pwin.c and play/win/pmin.c:  Add CYGWIN
            coding, including p_xhandler, w_hook_recurse, and p_signalling.

        3.  gistCmodule.c: Windows/Cygwin adjustments (e.g. 
            add pyg_on_idle calls for Windows); fix formats for pointers.

V021206 Munro 

        1.  gist/xbasic.c:  Change to gist_expose_wait.

        2.  play/play.h:  Add p_on_connect.

        3.  play/win/psrc.c:  Add p_on_connect.
  
        4.  play/win/wpoll.c:  Add w_nwins.

        5.  play/x11/connect.c:  Add p_on_connect.

        6.  gistCmodoule.c:  more fixes to get pygist working under windows
            and _tkinter.
            Macros for proper printing to stdout and stderr.
            Add pyg_unhook, pyg_idler, pyg_pending, and pyg_register.

V021126 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c: Add plg marker documentation.

V021125 Munro 

        1.  Reworked gistCmodule.c, g, gist, and play. 

            Added play/pmin.h and play/win/pmin.c.
            
            Note g_on_keyline hook.

V021119 Chase

        1.  Upgrade pygist to Yorick-1.5.13 from Dave Munro.

            - g/ps.ps and g/pscom.ps were changed. 
            - gist/*, play/*: Lots of changes, many source formatting

            Fixed bug in gist/gread.c.

        2.  gistCmodule.c:  Use gist interface (u_wait_stdin) provided by 
            Dave Munro for PyOS_InputHook.  Remove old solutions now 
            that play/unix has changed.

            This solution was tested on OSF/1, AIX, Linux, and cygwin.

V021115 Michiel de Hoon 

        Another approach to interfacing Python to Gist:
        This approach solves Dave Munro's concern about commenting out
        the if !serviced_event test in u_waiter.
        It also solves the slow updates of the cursor position; with this
        fix, the coordinates of the cursor position are updated immediately 
        when the mouse moves in the window.

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Add u_eventloop wrapper function around u_getc,
            and set PyOS_InputHook to it.

        2.  play/unix/ugetc.c:  Comment out getc function, so that just
            Python retrieves characters from stdin.

V021113 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Add back USE_RL_GETC to optionally 
            use rl_getc_function.  Also add to play/unix/umain.c. 

V021111 Chase

        1. gistCmodule.c:  Add Numeric to arrayobject.h include.

V021108 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Use pyfpe.h include and standard PyFFE* macros.

V021107 Chase

        1. gistCmodule.c:  Clean up some compiler warnings.

V021106 Chase

        1. play/x11/colors.c:  Fix drawing function problem per instructions
           from Dave Munro.

V021101 Chase

        Implement recommended changes from Michiel de Hoon,
        University of Tokyo (mdehoon@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp) to resolve a 
        problem getting events on cygwin, Linux, and AIX.

        1.  gistCmodule.c: Replace rl_getc_function with PyOS_InputHook.

        2.  play/unix/umain.c:  Michiel suggested a change to the uwaiter 
            function, but Dave Munro is concerned about loss of functionality
            with this omission.  For now, if the user wants this omitted, 
            undef UWAITER_TEST. 

V020904 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Deep copy string returned from PyString_AsString
            in setkw_string.

V020123 Chase

        1.  install.sh:  Comment out commands involving yorick, i, i0, and doc
            subdirectories.  Not relevant here.
            Also remove yorick/*.h from include file list.

V011217 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Add comments to slice2.

V011206 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Remove continue when E_TEXT type encountered 
            in legend.

V011204 Chase
    
        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Found that one replacement line (in plf) from the
            1.5 graph.c in yorick causes unaligned accesses and the
            test suite to fail.  Replace by previous form, which uses
            a temporary.  With this fix, the test suite runs to completion.

V011112 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Unpack color triples for true color. 
            Colors changed from int to unsigned long (1.4 to 1.5).
            Check for negative colors.

            Test 11 color cartoids now appear, but there is no legend on 
            Test 12.

V011108 Munro

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  Turn on idle function to do graphics tasks. 
            All plots now display, except test 11 & 12 (nested cartoid),
            probably related to color.

V011105 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c: Move all of the function documentation from 
            gist.help to doc strings for each PyObject defined here, 
            so it can be accessed with pydoc.

V011030 Chase

        1.  gistCmodule.c:  gistpath
            /graphics/gist is not /gist, 
            since the full graphics directory is not implemented.
