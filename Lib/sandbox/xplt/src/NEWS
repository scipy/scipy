------------------------------------------------------------------------

version 1.5.02

Mostly for Build-Depends fix to debian package.  Minor fixes to

problems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

02/may/01 version 1.5.01

First release of yorick-1.5.  The directory structure and
configuration scripts have completely changed; see the top-level
README for more.  The 1.5 version of yorick has the directory
structure, configuration scripts, and portability layer for
yorick-2.0, but still has the 1.4 interpreter.  The MacOS portion of
the portability layer is not yet present, but the Windows portion is
complete or nearly complete.

There are a few new features:

1. RGB colors supported for color= keyword, pli, plf, plfp
   see help,color or help,pli for more information

2. lsdir, mkdir, rmdir functions added so yorick can read and
   manipulate directories by itself

3. i86_primitives and other modern binary formats added
   see help,createb and help,__i86 for more information

4. cheby.i, convol.i, dawson.i, kepler.i added to interpreted
   library

5. added "hex" 3D transport solver (similar to drat 2D solver)

6. improved the emacs/yorick.el package again, mostly by removing
   unwanted "improvements" to emacs; see emacs/README

The yorick homepage and Web-based documentation has also been
completely reworked.  Visit

   ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/Yorick/

or the new homepage

   ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/Yorick/doc/index.html

You can download all this Web-based documentation (and the yorick and
texi2html scripts used to create it) from the downloads page there.
It is based on the work of Robert Cannon, who deserves most of the
credit but none of the blame for the new look.  Perhaps his best idea
is the HTML-ized source code for the entire interpreted library, which
makes it much easier to study the interpreted source code that comes
with the yorick distribution.  Ferdinand Jamitzky also helped by
making a first cut at converting the Quick Reference Cards to HTML; it
now works pretty much as well as the PDF or printed versions.
