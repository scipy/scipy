Idea for finding startup files on Mac:

(1) Installation places startup files in known location relative
    to application executable.
(2) Application uses a resource (NULL as shipped) to locate its
    startup files.
(3) If startup files are not found, application tries to find them
    relative to its initial current working directory.  If found,
    application writes its resource, so they will be found next
    time.
(4) User is instructed to double click on the application executable
    if resources are not found.  This starts the app with cwd in the
    place where (3) will find the startup files.

Idea for handling wide lines (which hang below and right - not centered):

(1) Use SetOrigin to shift port origin by half linewidth before drawing.
(2) Always construct and fill thick lines manually (necessary for
    round joins anyway).
