"""
   General overview of module pl3d:

   (1) Viewing transform machinery.  Arguably the simplest model
       is the CAD/CAM notion that the object you see is oriented
       as you see it in the current picture.  You can then move
       it left, right, up, down, or toward or away from you,
       or you can rotate it about any of the three axes (horizontal,
       vertical, or out of the screen).  The xyz coordinates of the
       object remains unchanged throughout all of this, but this
       object coordinate system changes relative to the fixed
       xyz of the viewer, in which x is always to the right, y is
       up, and z is directed out of the screen.  Initially, the
       two coordinate systems coincide.

       rot3 (xangle,yangle,zangle)
         Rotate the object about viewer's x-axis by xangle, then
         about viewer's y-axis by yangle, then about viewer's
         z-axis by zangle
       mov3 (xchange,ychange,zchange)
         Move the object by the specified amounts.

       setz3 (zcamera)
         The "camera" is located at (0,0,zcamera) in the viewer's
         coordinate system, looking in the minus-z direction.
         Initially, zcamera is very large, and the magnification
         factor is correspondingly large, giving an isometric view.
         Decreasing zcamera makes the perspective more extreme.
         If parts of the object are behind the camera, strange things
         may happen.

       undo3 ()
       undo3 (n)
         Undo the last N (default 1) viewpoint commands (rot3, mov3,
         or setz3).  Up to 100 viewpoint changes are remembered.
       viewpoint= save3()
       ...
       restore3 (viewpoint)
         The current viewpoint transformation can be saved and later
         restored.

       gnomon (on_off)
         Toggle the gnomon (a simple display showing the orientation
         of the xyz axes of the object).

      Sets lighting properties for 3D shading effects.
      A surface will be shaded according to its to its orientation
      relative to the viewing direction.

      The ambient level A_LEVEL is a light level (arbitrary units)
      that is added to every surface independent of its orientation.

      The diffuse level D_LEVEL is a light level which is proportional
      to cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the surface
      normal and the viewing direction, so that surfaces directly
      facing the viewer are bright, while surfaces viewed edge on are
      unlit (and surfaces facing away, if drawn, are shaded as if they
      faced the viewer).

      The specular level S_LEVEL is a light level proportional to a high
      power spower=N of 1+cos(alpha), where alpha is the angle between
      the specular reflection angle and the viewing direction.  The light
      source for the calculation of alpha lies in the direction XYZ (a
      3 element vector) in the viewer's coordinate system at infinite
      distance.  You can have ns light sources by making S_LEVEL, N, and
      XYZ (or any combination) be vectors of length ns (3-by-ns in the
      case of XYZ).  (See source code for specular_hook function
      definition if powers of 1+cos(alpha) aren't good enough for you.)

      With no arguments, return to the default lighting.

      light3 ( diffuse=.1, specular=1., sdir=[0,0,-1])
