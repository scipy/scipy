#
#  NAME:     wxtest.py
#
#  PURPOSE:  Test interaction when combining wxPython and PyGist
#
#  NOTES:
#  Dave Grote (LBNL) was able to develop a GUI with wxWindows and PyGist
#  because wxWindows has an idle event.  Because in wxPython, the idle
#  event is only called once each time the window goes idle, Dave came
#  up with a workaround available in wxPython (to request that another
#  idle event be sent).  His solution is illustrated below.
#
#  While we can get the GUI and the Gist window to each respond to
#  events, the solution is not perfect.  If the GUI window covers the
#  Gist window, the Gist window is not redrawn when exposed until the
#  mouse enters GUI window.
#
#  CHANGES:
#  03/06/03 llc Originated.
