Special installation instructions for various platforms
=======================================================

Win32 using MS VC++ 6.0 and Intel MKL
-------------------------------------

PySparse was sucessfully built with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 together
with the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL).

When adjusting "setup.py" you can use the settings under "elif hostname
== 'Rivendell':" and change the library_dirs_list according to your
MKL installation.

Before running the setup script please make sure that the VC++
executables are in your PATH environment variable.

It is also important that you include the directory containing the MKL
DLLs in your PATH environment variable. Otherwise runtime errors will
occur when PySparse is imported and called.
