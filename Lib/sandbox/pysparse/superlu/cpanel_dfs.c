/*
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 *   Performs a symbolic factorization on a panel of columns [jcol, jcol+w).
 *
 *   A supernode representative is the last column of a supernode.
 *   The nonzeros in U[*,j] are segments that end at supernodal
 *   representatives.
 *
 *   The routine returns one list of the supernodal representatives
 *   in topological order of the dfs that generates them. This list is
 *   a superset of the topological order of each individual column within
 *   the panel. 
 *   The location of the first nonzero in each supernodal segment
 *   (supernodal entry location) is also returned. Each column has a 
 *   separate list for this purpose.
 *
 *   Two marker arrays are used for dfs:
 *     marker[i] == jj, if i was visited during dfs of current column jj;
 *     marker1[i] >= jcol, if i was visited by earlier columns in this panel;
 *
 *   marker: A-row --> A-row/col (0/1)
 *   repfnz: SuperA-col --> PA-row
 *   parent: SuperA-col --> SuperA-col
 *   xplore: SuperA-col --> index to L-structure
