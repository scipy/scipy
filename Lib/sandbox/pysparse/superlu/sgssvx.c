 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 * SGSSVX solves the system of linear equations A*X=B or A'*X=B, using
 * the LU factorization from sgstrf(). Error bounds on the solution and
 * a condition estimate are also provided. It performs the following steps:
 *
 *   1. If A is stored column-wise (A->Stype = NC):
 *  
 *      1.1. If fact = 'E', scaling factors are computed to equilibrate the
 *           system:
 *             trans = 'N':  diag(R)*A*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
 *             trans = 'T': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
 *             trans = 'C': (diag(R)*A*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
 *           Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
 *           scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
 *           overwritten by diag(R)*A*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B (if trans='N')
 *           or diag(C)*B (if trans = 'T' or 'C').
 *
 *      1.2. Permute columns of A, forming A*Pc, where Pc is a permutation
 *           matrix that usually preserves sparsity.
 *           For more details of this step, see sp_preorder.c.
 *
 *      1.3. If fact = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the
 *           matrix A (after equilibration if fact = 'E') as Pr*A*Pc = L*U,
 *           with Pr determined by partial pivoting.
 *
 *      1.4. Compute the reciprocal pivot growth factor.
 *
 *      1.5. If some U(i,i) = 0, so that U is exactly singular, then the
 *           routine returns with info = i. Otherwise, the factored form of 
 *           A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A. If
 *           the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
 *           precision, info = A->ncol+1 is returned as a warning, but the
 *           routine still goes on to solve for X and computes error bounds
 *           as described below.
 *
 *      1.6. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
 *           of A.
 *
 *      1.7. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
 *           matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
 *           for it.
 *
 *      1.8. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
 *           diag(C) (if trans = 'N') or diag(R) (if trans = 'T' or 'C') so
 *           that it solves the original system before equilibration.
 *
 *   2. If A is stored row-wise (A->Stype = NR), apply the above algorithm
 *      to the transpose of A:
 *
 *      2.1. If fact = 'E', scaling factors are computed to equilibrate the
 *           system:
 *             trans = 'N':  diag(R)*A'*diag(C)     *inv(diag(C))*X = diag(R)*B
 *             trans = 'T': (diag(R)*A'*diag(C))**T *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
 *             trans = 'C': (diag(R)*A'*diag(C))**H *inv(diag(R))*X = diag(C)*B
 *           Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
 *           scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A' is
 *           overwritten by diag(R)*A'*diag(C) and B by diag(R)*B 
 *           (if trans='N') or diag(C)*B (if trans = 'T' or 'C').
 *
 *      2.2. Permute columns of transpose(A) (rows of A), 
 *           forming transpose(A)*Pc, where Pc is a permutation matrix that 
 *           usually preserves sparsity.
 *           For more details of this step, see sp_preorder.c.
 *
 *      2.3. If fact = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor the
 *           transpose(A) (after equilibration if fact = 'E') as 
 *           Pr*transpose(A)*Pc = L*U with the permutation Pr determined by
 *           partial pivoting.
 *
 *      2.4. Compute the reciprocal pivot growth factor.
 *
 *      2.5. If some U(i,i) = 0, so that U is exactly singular, then the
 *           routine returns with info = i. Otherwise, the factored form 
 *           of transpose(A) is used to estimate the condition number of the
 *           matrix A. If the reciprocal of the condition number
 *           is less than machine precision, info = A->nrow+1 is returned as
 *           a warning, but the routine still goes on to solve for X and
 *           computes error bounds as described below.
 *
 *      2.6. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
 *           of transpose(A).
 *
 *      2.7. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
 *           matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
 *           for it.
 *
 *      2.8. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
 *           diag(C) (if trans = 'N') or diag(R) (if trans = 'T' or 'C') so
 *           that it solves the original system before equilibration.
 *
 *   See supermatrix.h for the definition of 'SuperMatrix' structure.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * fact    (input) char*
 *         Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix
 *         A is supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should
 *         be equilibrated before it is factored.
 *         = 'F': On entry, L, U, perm_r and perm_c contain the factored
 *                form of A. If equed is not 'N', the matrix A has been
 *                equilibrated with scaling factors R and C.
 *                A, L, U, perm_r are not modified.
 *         = 'N': The matrix A will be factored, and the factors will be
 *                stored in L and U.
 *         = 'E': The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
 *                factored into L and U.
 *
 * trans   (input) char*
 *         Specifies the form of the system of equations:
 *         = 'N': A * X = B        (No transpose)
 *         = 'T': A**T * X = B     (Transpose)
 *         = 'C': A**H * X = B     (Transpose)
 *
 * refact  (input) char*
 *         Specifies whether we want to re-factor the matrix.
 *         = 'N': Factor the matrix A.
 *         = 'Y': Matrix A was factored before, now we want to re-factor
 *                matrix A with perm_r and etree as inputs. Use
 *                the same storage for the L\U factors previously allocated,
 *                expand it if necessary. User should insure to use the same
 *                memory model.  In this case, perm_r may be modified due to
 *                different pivoting determined by diagonal threshold.
 *         If fact = 'F', then refact is not accessed.
 *
 * A       (input/output) SuperMatrix*
 *         Matrix A in A*X=B, of dimension (A->nrow, A->ncol). The number
 *         of the linear equations is A->nrow. Currently, the type of A can be:
 *         Stype = NC or NR, Dtype = S_, Mtype = GE. In the future,
 *         more general A can be handled.
 *
 *         On entry, If fact = 'F' and equed is not 'N', then A must have
 *         been equilibrated by the scaling factors in R and/or C.  
 *         A is not modified if fact = 'F' or 'N', or if fact = 'E' and 
 *         equed = 'N' on exit.
 *
 *         On exit, if fact = 'E' and equed is not 'N', A is scaled as follows:
 *         If A->Stype = NC:
 *           equed = 'R':  A := diag(R) * A
 *           equed = 'C':  A := A * diag(C)
 *           equed = 'B':  A := diag(R) * A * diag(C).
 *         If A->Stype = NR:
 *           equed = 'R':  transpose(A) := diag(R) * transpose(A)
 *           equed = 'C':  transpose(A) := transpose(A) * diag(C)
 *           equed = 'B':  transpose(A) := diag(R) * transpose(A) * diag(C).
 *
 * factor_params (input) factor_param_t*
 *         The structure defines the input scalar parameters, consisting of
 *         the following fields. If factor_params = NULL, the default
 *         values are used for all the fields; otherwise, the values
 *         are given by the user.
 *         - panel_size (int): Panel size. A panel consists of at most
 *             panel_size consecutive columns. If panel_size = -1, use 
 *             default value 8.
 *         - relax (int): To control degree of relaxing supernodes. If the
 *             number of nodes (columns) in a subtree of the elimination
 *             tree is less than relax, this subtree is considered as one
 *             supernode, regardless of the row structures of those columns.
 *             If relax = -1, use default value 8.
 *         - diag_pivot_thresh (float): Diagonal pivoting threshold.
 *             At step j of the Gaussian elimination, if
 *                 abs(A_jj) >= diag_pivot_thresh * (max_(i>=j) abs(A_ij)),
 *             then use A_jj as pivot. 0 <= diag_pivot_thresh <= 1.
 *             If diag_pivot_thresh = -1, use default value 1.0,
 *             which corresponds to standard partial pivoting.
 *         - drop_tol (double): Drop tolerance threshold. (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
 *             At step j of the Gaussian elimination, if
 *                 abs(A_ij)/(max_i abs(A_ij)) < drop_tol,
 *             then drop entry A_ij. 0 <= drop_tol <= 1.
 *             If drop_tol = -1, use default value 0.0, which corresponds to
 *             standard Gaussian elimination.
 *
 * perm_c  (input/output) int*
 *	   If A->Stype = NC, Column permutation vector of size A->ncol,
 *         which defines the permutation matrix Pc; perm_c[i] = j means
 *         column i of A is in position j in A*Pc.
 *         On exit, perm_c may be overwritten by the product of the input
 *         perm_c and a permutation that postorders the elimination tree
 *         of Pc'*A'*A*Pc; perm_c is not changed if the elimination tree
 *         is already in postorder.
 *
 *         If A->Stype = NR, column permutation vector of size A->nrow,
 *         which describes permutation of columns of transpose(A) 
 *         (rows of A) as described above.
 * 
 * perm_r  (input/output) int*
 *         If A->Stype = NC, row permutation vector of size A->nrow, 
 *         which defines the permutation matrix Pr, and is determined
 *         by partial pivoting.  perm_r[i] = j means row i of A is in 
 *         position j in Pr*A.
 *
 *         If A->Stype = NR, permutation vector of size A->ncol, which
 *         determines permutation of rows of transpose(A)
 *         (columns of A) as described above.
 *
 *         If refact is not 'Y', perm_r is output argument;
 *         If refact = 'Y', the pivoting routine will try to use the input
 *         perm_r, unless a certain threshold criterion is violated.
 *         In that case, perm_r is overwritten by a new permutation
 *         determined by partial pivoting or diagonal threshold pivoting.
 * 
 * etree   (input/output) int*,  dimension (A->ncol)
 *         Elimination tree of Pc'*A'*A*Pc.
 *         If fact is not 'F' and refact = 'Y', etree is an input argument,
 *         otherwise it is an output argument.
 *         Note: etree is a vector of parent pointers for a forest whose
 *         vertices are the integers 0 to A->ncol-1; etree[root]==A->ncol.
 *
 * equed   (input/output) char*
 *         Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
 *         = 'N': No equilibration.
 *         = 'R': Row equilibration, i.e., A was premultiplied by diag(R).
 *         = 'C': Column equilibration, i.e., A was postmultiplied by diag(C).
 *         = 'B': Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A was replaced 
 *                by diag(R)*A*diag(C).
 *         If fact = 'F', equed is an input argument, otherwise it is
 *         an output argument.
 *
 * R       (input/output) float*, dimension (A->nrow)
 *         The row scale factors for A or transpose(A).
 *         If equed = 'R' or 'B', A (if A->Stype = NC) or transpose(A) (if
 *             A->Stype = NR) is multiplied on the left by diag(R).
 *         If equed = 'N' or 'C', R is not accessed.
 *         If fact = 'F', R is an input argument; otherwise, R is output.
 *         If fact = 'F' and equed = 'R' or 'B', each element of R must
 *            be positive.
 * 
 * C       (input/output) float*, dimension (A->ncol)
 *         The column scale factors for A or transpose(A).
 *         If equed = 'C' or 'B', A (if A->Stype = NC) or transpose(A) (if 
 *             A->Stype = NR) is multiplied on the right by diag(C).
 *         If equed = 'N' or 'R', C is not accessed.
 *         If fact = 'F', C is an input argument; otherwise, C is output.
 *         If fact = 'F' and equed = 'C' or 'B', each element of C must
 *            be positive.
 *         
 * L       (output) SuperMatrix*
 *	   The factor L from the factorization
 *             Pr*A*Pc=L*U              (if A->Stype = NC) or
 *             Pr*transpose(A)*Pc=L*U   (if A->Stype = NR).
 *         Uses compressed row subscripts storage for supernodes, i.e.,
 *         L has types: Stype = SC, Dtype = S_, Mtype = TRLU.
 *
 * U       (output) SuperMatrix*
 *	   The factor U from the factorization
 *             Pr*A*Pc=L*U              (if A->Stype = NC) or
 *             Pr*transpose(A)*Pc=L*U   (if A->Stype = NR).
 *         Uses column-wise storage scheme, i.e., U has types:
 *         Stype = NC, Dtype = S_, Mtype = TRU.
 *
 * work    (workspace/output) void*, size (lwork) (in bytes)
 *         User supplied workspace, should be large enough
 *         to hold data structures for factors L and U.
 *         On exit, if fact is not 'F', L and U point to this array.
 *
 * lwork   (input) int
 *         Specifies the size of work array in bytes.
 *         = 0:  allocate space internally by system malloc;
 *         > 0:  use user-supplied work array of length lwork in bytes,
 *               returns error if space runs out.
 *         = -1: the routine guesses the amount of space needed without
 *               performing the factorization, and returns it in
 *               mem_usage->total_needed; no other side effects.
 *
 *         See argument 'mem_usage' for memory usage statistics.
 *
 * B       (input/output) SuperMatrix*
 *         B has types: Stype = DN, Dtype = S_, Mtype = GE.
 *         On entry, the right hand side matrix.
 *         On exit,
 *            if equed = 'N', B is not modified; otherwise
 *            if A->Stype = NC:
 *               if trans = 'N' and equed = 'R' or 'B', B is overwritten by
 *                  diag(R)*B;
 *               if trans = 'T' or 'C' and equed = 'C' of 'B', B is
 *                  overwritten by diag(C)*B;
 *            if A->Stype = NR:
 *               if trans = 'N' and equed = 'C' or 'B', B is overwritten by
 *                  diag(C)*B;
 *               if trans = 'T' or 'C' and equed = 'R' of 'B', B is
 *                  overwritten by diag(R)*B.
 *
 * X       (output) SuperMatrix*
 *         X has types: Stype = DN, Dtype = S_, Mtype = GE. 
 *         If info = 0 or info = A->ncol+1, X contains the solution matrix
 *         to the original system of equations. Note that A and B are modified
 *         on exit if equed is not 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated
 *         system is inv(diag(C))*X if trans = 'N' and equed = 'C' or 'B',
 *         or inv(diag(R))*X if trans = 'T' or 'C' and equed = 'R' or 'B'.
 *
 * recip_pivot_growth (output) float*
 *         The reciprocal pivot growth factor max_j( norm(A_j)/norm(U_j) ).
 *         The infinity norm is used. If recip_pivot_growth is much less
 *         than 1, the stability of the LU factorization could be poor.
 *
 * rcond   (output) float*
 *         The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix A
 *         after equilibration (if done). If rcond is less than the machine
 *         precision (in particular, if rcond = 0), the matrix is singular
 *         to working precision. This condition is indicated by a return
 *         code of info > 0.
 *
 * FERR    (output) float*, dimension (B->ncol)   
 *         The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector   
 *         X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).   
 *         If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j) 
 *         is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest 
 *         element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the   
 *         largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as   
 *         the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight   
 *         overestimate of the true error.
 *
 * BERR    (output) float*, dimension (B->ncol)
 *         The componentwise relative backward error of each solution   
 *         vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in   
 *         any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).
 *
 * mem_usage (output) mem_usage_t*
 *         Record the memory usage statistics, consisting of following fields:
 *         - for_lu (float)
 *           The amount of space used in bytes for L\U data structures.
 *         - total_needed (float)
 *           The amount of space needed in bytes to perform factorization.
 *         - expansions (int)
 *           The number of memory expansions during the LU factorization.
 *
 * info    (output) int*
 *         = 0: successful exit   
 *         < 0: if info = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value   
 *         > 0: if info = i, and i is   
 *              <= A->ncol: U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization has   
 *                    been completed, but the factor U is exactly   
 *                    singular, so the solution and error bounds   
 *                    could not be computed.   
 *              = A->ncol+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
 *                    precision, meaning that the matrix is singular to
 *                    working precision. Nevertheless, the solution and
 *                    error bounds are computed because there are a number
 *                    of situations where the computed solution can be more
 *                    accurate than the value of RCOND would suggest.   
 *              > A->ncol+1: number of bytes allocated when memory allocation
 *                    failure occurred, plus A->ncol.
