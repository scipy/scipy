Routines for Monte Carlo simulation
===================================

Tools for Monte Carlo simulations.  Some of these routines need to be
spun out into separate compiled code in C or Fortran.  Once they are
complete they might belong under random/.

They are currently used by the examples accompanying the maximum entropy
module.
