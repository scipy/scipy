""" Vector Quantization Module

    Provides several routines used in creating a code book from a set of
    observations and comparing a set of observations to a code book.
    
    All routines expect an "observation vector" to be stored in each
    row of the obs matrix.  Similarly the codes are stored row wise
    in the code book matrix.

        Description
        
            Before running kmeans algorithms, it is beneficial to "whiten", or
            scale, the observation data on a per feature basis.  This is done
            by dividing each feature by its standard deviation across all 
            observations.

            obs -- 2D array.
                    Each row of the array is an observation.  The
                    columns are the "features" seen during each observation

        Description:
            Vector quantization determines which code in the code book best
            represents an observation of a target.  The features of each
            observation are compared to each code in the book, and assigned 
            the one closest to it.  The observations are contained in the obs 
            array. These features should be "whitened," or nomalized by the 
            standard deviation of all the features before being quantized.  
            The code book can be created using the kmeans algorithm or 
            something similar.
    
        Note: 
           This currently forces 32 bit math precision for speed.  Anyone know
           of a situation where this undermines the accuracy of the algorithm?
