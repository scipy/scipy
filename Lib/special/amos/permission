Subject: amos

As I install the new dependency resolution mechanism for netlib, I'm
recompiling lots of libraries, sometimes for the first time in years.
The amos collection is causing me trouble because it defines a function
zabs() which the SGI compiler believes is an intrinsic (with different
arguments).  For expediency, I'm just dropping the "-l" prefix from amos
in /netlib/admin/LIBS.
