For inclusion in the cephes library.  The routines here need to be compiled
in a library and then linked with the module code.  Only the double precision
routines are included.  Pay attention to i1mach.f and d1mach.f which must be
modified to match your architecture.  Right now they are set for IBM_PC.
This may also work for any IEEE 754 conforming machine.
