      subroutine dgbfa(abd,lda,n,ml,mu,ipvt,info)
      integer lda,n,ml,mu,ipvt(1),info
      double precision abd(lda,1)
c
c     dgbfa factors a double precision band matrix by elimination.
c
c     dgbfa is usually called by dgbco, but it can be called
c     directly with a saving in time if  rcond  is not needed.
c
c     on entry
c
c        abd     double precision(lda, n)
c                contains the matrix in band storage.  the columns
c                of the matrix are stored in the columns of  abd  and
c                the diagonals of the matrix are stored in rows
c                ml+1 through 2*ml+mu+1 of  abd .
c                see the comments below for details.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array  abd .
c                lda must be .ge. 2*ml + mu + 1 .
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the original matrix.
c
c        ml      integer
c                number of diagonals below the main diagonal.
c                0 .le. ml .lt. n .
c
c        mu      integer
c                number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
c                0 .le. mu .lt. n .
c                more efficient if  ml .le. mu .
c     on return
c
c        abd     an upper triangular matrix in band storage and
c                the multipliers which were used to obtain it.
c                the factorization can be written  a = l*u  where
c                l  is a product of permutation and unit lower
c                triangular matrices and  u  is upper triangular.
c
c        ipvt    integer(n)
c                an integer vector of pivot indices.
c
c        info    integer
c                = 0  normal value.
c                = k  if  u(k,k) .eq. 0.0 .  this is not an error
c                     condition for this subroutine, but it does
c                     indicate that dgbsl will divide by zero if
c                     called.  use  rcond  in dgbco for a reliable
c                     indication of singularity.
c
c     band storage
c
c           if  a  is a band matrix, the following program segment
c           will set up the input.
c
c                   ml = (band width below the diagonal)
c                   mu = (band width above the diagonal)
c                   m = ml + mu + 1
c                   do 20 j = 1, n
c                      i1 = max0(1, j-mu)
c                      i2 = min0(n, j+ml)
c                      do 10 i = i1, i2
c                         k = i - j + m
c                         abd(k,j) = a(i,j)
c                10    continue
c                20 continue
c
c           this uses rows  ml+1  through  2*ml+mu+1  of  abd .
c           in addition, the first  ml  rows in  abd  are used for
c           elements generated during the triangularization.
c           the total number of rows needed in  abd  is  2*ml+mu+1 .
c           the  ml+mu by ml+mu  upper left triangle and the
c           ml by ml  lower right triangle are not referenced.
