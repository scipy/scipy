c summary of usage.
c
c communication between the user and the lsodi package, for normal
c situations, is summarized here.  this summary describes only a subset
c of the full set of options available.  see the full description for
c details, including optional communication, nonstandard options,
c and instructions for special situations.  see also the example
c problem (with program and output) following this summary.
c
c a. first, provide a subroutine of the form..
c               subroutine res (neq, t, y, s, r, ires)
c               dimension y(neq), s(neq), r(neq)
c which computes the residual function
c     r = g(t,y)  -  a(t,y) * s ,
c as a function of t and the vectors y and s.  (s is an internally
c generated approximation to dy/dt.)  the arrays y and s are inputs
c to the res routine and should not be altered.  the residual
c vector is to be stored in the array r.  the argument ires should be
c ignored for casual use of lsodi.  (for uses of ires, see the
c paragraph on res in the full description below.)
c
c b. next, decide whether full or banded form is more economical
c for the storage of matrices.  lsodi must deal internally with the
c matrices a and dr/dy, where r is the residual function defined above.
c lsodi generates a linear combination of these two matrices, and
c this is treated in either full or banded form.
c     the matrix structure is communicated by a method flag mf,
c which is 21 or 22 for the full case, and 24 or 25 in the band case.
c     in the banded case, lsodi requires two half-bandwidth
c parameters ml and mu.  these are, respectively, the widths of the
c lower and upper parts of the band, excluding the main diagonal.
c thus the band consists of the locations (i,j) with
c i-ml .le. j .le. i+mu, and the full bandwidth is ml+mu+1.
c note that the band must accommodate the nonzero elements of
c a(t,y), dg/dy, and d(a*s)/dy (s fixed).  alternatively, one
c can define a band that encloses only the elements that are relatively
c large in magnitude, and gain some economy in storage and possibly
c also efficiency, although the appropriate threshhold for
c retaining matrix elements is highly problem-dependent.
c
c c. you must also provide a subroutine of the form..
c               subroutine adda (neq, t, y, ml, mu, p, nrowp)
c               dimension y(neq), p(nrowp,neq)
c which adds the matrix a = a(t,y) to the contents of the array p.
c t and the y array are input and should not be altered.
c     in the full matrix case, this routine should add elements of
c to p in the usual order.  i.e., add a(i,j) to p(i,j).  (ignore the
c ml and mu arguments in this case.)
c     in the band matrix case, this routine should add element a(i,j)
c to p(i-j+mu+1,j).  i.e., add the diagonal lines of a to the rows of
c p from the top down (the top line of a added to the first row of p).
c
c d. for the sake of efficiency, you are encouraged to supply the
c jacobian matrix dr/dy in closed form, where r = g(t,y) - a(t,y)*s
c (s = a fixed vector) as above.  if dr/dy is being supplied,
c use mf = 21 or 24, and provide a subroutine of the form..
c               subroutine jac (neq, t, y, s, ml, mu, p, nrowp)
c               dimension y(neq), s(neq), p(nrowp,neq)
c which computes dr/dy as a function of t, y, and s.  here t, y, and
c s are inputs, and the routine is to load dr/dy into p as follows..
c     in the full matrix case (mf = 21), load p(i,j) with dr(i)/dy(j),
c the partial derivative of r(i) with respect to y(j).  (ignore the
c ml and mu arguments in this case.)
c     in the band matrix case (mf = 24), load p(i-j+mu+1,j) with
c dr(i)/dy(j), i.e. load the diagonal lines of dr/dy into the rows of
c p from the top down.
c     in either case, only nonzero elements need be loaded, and the
c indexing of p is the same as in the adda routine.
c     note that if a is independent of y (or this dependence
c is weak enough to be ignored) then jac is to compute dg/dy.
c     if it is not feasible to provide a jac routine, use
c mf = 22 or 25, and lsodi will compute an approximate jacobian
c internally by difference quotients.
c
c e. next decide whether or not to provide the initial value of the
c derivative vector dy/dt.  if the initial value of a(t,y) is
c nonsingular (and not too ill-conditioned), you may let lsodi compute
c this vector (istate = 0).  (lsodi will solve the system a*s = g for
c s, with initial values of a and g.)  if a(t,y) is initially
c singular, then the system is a differential-algebraic system, and
c you must make use of the particular form of the system to compute the
c initial values of y and dy/dt.  in that case, use istate = 1 and
c load the initial value of dy/dt into the array ydoti.
c the input array ydoti and the initial y array must be consistent with
c the equations a*dy/dt = g.  this implies that the initial residual
c r = g(t,y) - a(t,y)*ydoti   must be approximately zero.
c
c f. write a main program which calls subroutine lsodi once for
c each point at which answers are desired.  this should also provide
c for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
c by lsodi.  on the first call to lsodi, supply arguments as follows..
c res    = name of user subroutine for residual function r.
c adda   = name of user subroutine for computing and adding a(t,y).
c jac    = name of user subroutine for jacobian matrix dr/dy
c          (mf = 21 or 24).  if not used, pass a dummy name.
c note.. the names for the res and adda routines and (if used) the
c        jac routine must be declared external in the calling program.
c neq    = number of scalar equations in the system.
c y      = array of initial values, of length neq.
c ydoti  = array of length neq (containing initial dy/dt if istate = 1).
c t      = the initial value of the independent variable.
c tout   = first point where output is desired (.ne. t).
c itol   = 1 or 2 according as atol (below) is a scalar or array.
c rtol   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
c atol   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
c          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
c          to be roughly less (in magnitude) than
c             ewt(i) = rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol     if itol = 1, or
c             ewt(i) = rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)  if itol = 2.
c          thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
c          either the absolute error is less than atol (or atol(i)),
c          or the relative error is less than rtol.
c          use rtol = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
c          use atol = 0.0 (or atol(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
c          control.  caution.. actual (global) errors may exceed these
c          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
c itask  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = tout.
c istate = integer flag (input and output).  set istate = 1 if the
c          initial dy/dt is supplied, and 0 otherwise.
c iopt   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
c rwork  = real work array of length at least..
c             22 +  9*neq + neq**2           for mf = 21 or 22,
c             22 + 10*neq + (2*ml + mu)*neq  for mf = 24 or 25.
c lrw    = declared length of rwork (in user-s dimension).
c iwork  = integer work array of length at least 20 + neq.
c          if mf = 24 or 25, input in iwork(1),iwork(2) the lower
c          and upper half-bandwidths ml,mu.
c liw    = declared length of iwork (in user-s dimension).
c mf     = method flag.  standard values are..
c          21 for a user-supplied full jacobian.
c          22 for an internally generated full jacobian.
c          24 for a user-supplied banded jacobian.
c          25 for an internally generated banded jacobian.
c          for other choices of mf, see the paragraph on mf in
c          the full description below.
c note that the main program must declare arrays y, ydoti, rwork, iwork,
c and possibly atol.
c
c g. the output from the first call (or any call) is..
c      y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
c      t = corresponding value of independent variable (normally tout).
c istate = 2  if lsodi was successful, negative otherwise.
c          -1 means excess work done on this call (check all inputs).
c          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
c          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
c          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
c          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad jacobian
c             supplied or wrong choice of tolerances).
c          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (solution
c             component i vanished, and atol or atol(i) = 0.)
c          -7 cannot occur in casual use.
c          -8 means lsodi was unable to compute the initial dy/dt.
c             in casual use, this means a(t,y) is initially singular.
c             supply ydoti and use istate = 1 on the first call.
c
c  if lsodi returns istate = -1, -4, or -5, then the output of
c  lsodi also includes ydoti = array containing residual vector
c  r = g - a * dy/dt  evaluated at the current t, y, and dy/dt.
c
c h. to continue the integration after a successful return, simply
c reset tout and call lsodi again.  no other parameters need be reset.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c example problem.
c
c the following is a simple example problem, with the coding
c needed for its solution by lsodi.  the problem is from chemical
c kinetics, and consists of the following three equations..
c     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
c     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
c       0.   = y1 + y2 + y3 - 1.
c on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
c y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.
c
c the following coding solves this problem with lsodi, using mf = 21
c and printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  it uses
c itol = 2 and atol much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
c y2 has much smaller values.  dy/dt is supplied in ydoti. we had
c obtained the initial value of dy3/dt by differentiating the
c third equation and evaluating the first two at t=0.
c at the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
c printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

c full description of user interface to lsodi.
c
c the user interface to lsodi consists of the following parts.
c
c i.   the call sequence to subroutine lsodi, which is a driver
c      routine for the solver.  this includes descriptions of both
c      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
c      following these descriptions is a description of
c      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
c      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
c
c ii.  descriptions of other routines in the lsodi package that may be
c      (optionally) called by the user.  these provide the ability to
c      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
c      common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
c
c iii. descriptions of common blocks to be declared in overlay
c      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
c      of the problem and continued solution later.
c
c iv.  description of two routines in the lsodi package, either of
c      which the user may replace with his own version, if desired.
c      these relate to the measurement of errors.
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part i.  call sequence.
c
c the call sequence parameters used for input only are
c     res, adda, jac, neq, tout, itol, rtol, atol, itask,
c     iopt, lrw, liw, mf,
c and those used for both input and output are
c     y, t, istate, ydoti.
c the work arrays rwork and iwork are also used for conditional and
c optional inputs and optional outputs.  (the term output here refers
c to the return from subroutine lsodi to the user-s calling program.)
c
c the legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
c initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
c change in input parameters is flagged by istate = 3 on input.
c
c the descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
c
c res    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
c          the residual vector for the ode system, defined by
c            r = g(t,y) - a(t,y) * s
c          as a function of the scalar t and the vectors
c          s and y ( s approximates dy/dt ). this
c          subroutine is to have the form
c              subroutine res ( neq, t, y, s, r, ires )
c              dimension y(1), s(1), r(1)
c          where neq, t, y, s, and ires are input, and r and
c          ires are output. y, s, and r are arrays of length neq.
c          in dimension statements such as that above, 1 is a
c          dummy dimension. it can be replaced by any value.
c             on input, ires indicates how lsodi will use the
c          returned array r, as follows..
c             ires = 1  means that lsodi needs the full residual,
c                       r = g - a*s, exactly.
c             ires = -1 means that lsodi is using r only to compute
c                       the jacobian dr/dy by difference quotients.
c          the res routine can ignore ires, or it can omit some terms
c          if ires = -1.  if a does not depend on y, then res can
c          just return r = g when ires = -1.  if g - a*s contains other
c          additive terms that are independent of y, these can also be
c          dropped, if done consistently, when ires = -1.
c             the subroutine should set the flag ires if it
c          encounters a halt condition or illegal input.
c          otherwise, it should not reset ires.  on output,
c             ires = 1 or -1 represents a normal return, and
c          lsodi continues integrating the ode.  leave ires
c          unchanged from its input value.
c             ires = 2 tells lsodi to immediately return control
c          to the calling program, with istate = 3.  this lets
c          the calling program change parameters of the prob-
c          lem if necessary.
c             ires = 3 represents an error condition (for example, an
c          illegal value of y). lsodi tries to integrate the ode without
c          getting ires = 3 from res.  if it cannot, lsodi returns
c          with istate = -7 or -1.
c             on an lsodi return with istate = 3, -1, or -7, the values
c          of t and y returned correspond to the last point reached
c          successfully without getting the flag ires = 2 or 3.
c             the flag values ires = 2 and 3 should not be used to
c          handle switches or root-stop conditions.  this is better
c          done by calling lsodi in a one-step mode and checking the
c          stopping function for a sign change at each step.
c             if quantities computed in the res routine are needed
c          externally to lsodi, an extra call to res should be made
c          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
c          to get the current dy/dt for the s argument, use intdy.
c             res must be declared external in the calling
c          program.  see note below for more about res.
c
c adda   = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which adds
c          the matrix a = a(t,y) to another matrix stored in the same
c          form as a. the storage form is determined by miter (see
c          mf).  this subroutine is to have the form
c               subroutine adda ( neq, t, y, ml, mu, p, nrowp )
c               dimension y(1), p(nrowp,1)
c          where neq, t, y, ml, mu, and nrowp are input and p is
c          output. y is an array of length neq, and the matrix p is
c          stored in an nrowp by neq array.
c             in the full matrix case ( miter =  1 or 2 ) adda should
c          add  a    to p(i,j). ml and mu are ignored.
c                i,j
c             in the band matrix case ( miter = 4 or 5 ) adda should
c          add  a    to  p(i-j+mu+1,j).
c                i,j
c          see jac for details on this band storage form.
c             adda must be declared external in the calling program.
c          see note below for more information about adda.
c
c jac    = the name of the user-supplied subroutine which supplies
c          the jacobian matrix, dr/dy, where r = g-a*s. the form of the
c          jacobian matrix is determined by miter. jac is required
c          if miter = 1 or 4 -- otherwise a dummy name can be
c          passed. this subroutine is to have the form
c               subroutine jac ( neq, t, y, s, ml, mu, p, nrowp )
c               dimension y(1), s(1), p(nrowp,1)
c          where neq, t, y, s, ml, mu, and nrowp are input and p
c          is output. y and s are arrays of length neq, and the
c          matrix p is stored in an nrowp by neq array.
c          p is to be loaded with partial derivatives ( elements
c          of the jacobian matrix ) on output.
c             in the full matrix case ( miter = 1 ), ml and mu
c          are ignored and the jacobian is to be loaded into p
c          by columns- i.e., dr(i)/dy(j) is loaded into p(i,j).
c             in the band matrix case ( miter = 4 ), the ele-
c          ments within the band are to be loaded into p by
c          by columns, with diagonal lines of dr/dy loaded into
c          the rows of p.  thus dr(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded
c          into p(i-j+mu+1,j). the locations in p in the two
c          triangular areas which correspond to nonexistent matrix
c          elements can be ignored or loaded arbitrarily, as they
c          they are overwritten by lsodi. ml and mu are the half-
c          bandwidth parameters ( see iwork ).
c               in either case, p is preset to zero by the solver,
c          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by jac.
c          each call to jac is preceded by a call to res with the same
c          arguments neq, t, y, and s.  thus to gain some efficiency,
c          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
c          saved in a user common block by res and not recomputed by jac
c          if desired.  also, jac may alter the y array, if desired.
c               jac need not provide dr/dy exactly.  a crude
c          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
c               jac must be declared external in the calling program.
c               see note below for more about jac.
c
c       note on res, adda, and jac--  these
c          subroutines may access user-defined quantities in
c          neq(2),... and/or in y(neq(1)+1),... if neq is an array
c          (dimensioned in the subroutines) and/or y has length
c          exceeding neq(1).  however, these routines should not alter
c          neq(1), y(1),...,y(neq) or any other input variables.
c          see the descriptions of neq and y below.
c
c neq    = the size of the system (number of first order ordinary
c          differential equations or scalar algebraic equations).
c          used only for input.
c          neq may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
c          if neq is decreased (with istate = 3 on input), the
c          remaining components of y should be left undisturbed, if
c          these are to be accessed in res, adda, or jac.
c
c          normally, neq is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
c          as a scalar in this user interface description.  however,
c          neq may be an array, with neq(1) set to the system size.
c          (the lsodi package accesses only neq(1).)  in either case,
c          this parameter is passed as the neq argument in all calls
c          to res, adda, and jac.  hence, if it is an array,
c          locations neq(2),... may be used to store other integer data
c          and pass it to  res, adda, or jac.  each such subroutine
c          must include neq in a dimension statement in that case.
c
c y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
c          length neq or more.  used for both input and output on the
c          first call (istate = 0 or 1), and only for output on other
c          calls.  on the first call, y must contain the vector of
c          initial values.  on output, y contains the computed solution
c          vector, evaluated at t.  if desired, the y array may be used
c          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
c
c          this array is passed as the y argument in all calls to res,
c          adda, and jac.  hence its length may exceed neq,
c          and locations y(neq+1),... may be used to store other real
c          data and pass it to res, adda, or jac.  (the lsodi
c          package accesses only y(1),...,y(neq). )
c
c ydoti  = a real array for the initial value of the vector
c          dy/dt and for work space, of dimension at least neq.
c
c          on input...
c            if istate = 0 then lsodi will compute the initial value
c          of dy/dt, if a is nonsingular.  thus ydoti will
c          serve only as work space and may have any value.
c            if istate = 1 then ydoti must contain the initial value
c          of dy/dt.
c            if istate = 2 or 3 (continuation calls) then ydoti
c          may have any value.
c            n.b.- if the initial value of a is singular, then
c          lsodi cannot compute the initial value of dy/dt, so
c          it must be provided in ydoti, with istate=1.
c
c          on output, when lsodi terminates abnormally with istate =
c          -1, -4, or -5, ydoti will contain the residual
c          r = g(t,y) - a(t,y)*(dy/dt).  if r is large, t is near
c          its initial value, and ydoti is supplied with istate=1,
c          there may have been an incorrect input value of
c          ydoti = dy/dt or the problem ( as given to lsodi )
c          may not have a solution.
c
c          if desired, the ydoti array may be used for other
c          purposes between calls to the solver.
c
c t      = the independent variable.  on input, t is used only on the
c          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
c          on output, after each call, t is the value at which a
c          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as tout).
c          on an error return, t is the farthest point reached.
c
c tout   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
c          used only for input.
c
c          when starting the problem (istate = 0 or 1), tout may be
c          equal to t for one call, then should .ne. t for the next
c          call.  for the initial t, an input value of tout .ne. t is
c          used in order to determine the direction of the integration
c          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
c          scale of the problem.  integration in either direction
c          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
c
c          if itask = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), tout is ignored after
c          the first call (i.e. the first call with tout .ne. t).
c          otherwise, tout is required on every call.
c
c          if itask = 1, 3, or 4, the values of tout need not be
c          monotone, but a value of tout which backs up is limited
c          to the current internal t interval, whose endpoints are
c          tcur - hu and tcur (see optional outputs, below, for
c          tcur and hu).
c
c itol   = an indicator for the type of error control.  see
c          description below under atol.  used only for input.
c
c rtol   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
c          an array of length neq.  see description below under atol.
c          input only.
c
c atol   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
c          an array of length neq.  input only.
c
c             the input parameters itol, rtol, and atol determine
c          the error control performed by the solver.  the solver will
c          control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors
c          in y, according to an inequality of the form
c                      rms-norm of ( e(i)/ewt(i) )   .le.   1,
c          where       ewt(i) = rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol(i),
c          and the rms-norm (root-mean-square norm) here is
c          rms-norm(v) = sqrt(sum v(i)**2 / neq).  here ewt = (ewt(i))
c          is a vector of weights which must always be positive, and
c          the values of rtol and atol should all be non-negative.
c          the following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
c          rtol and atol, and the corresponding form of ewt(i).
c
c             itol    rtol       atol          ewt(i)
c              1     scalar     scalar     rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol
c              2     scalar     array      rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)
c              3     array      scalar     rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol
c              4     array      scalar     rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)
c
c          when either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
c          be dimensioned in the user-s calling program.
c
c          if none of the above choices (with itol, rtol, and atol
c          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
c          error controls can be obtained by substituting
c          user-supplied routines for the setting of ewt and/or for
c          the norm calculation.  see part iv below.
c
c          if global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
c          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
c          components of rtol and atol (i.e. of ewt) should be scaled
c          down uniformly
c
c itask  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
c          input only.  itask has the following values and meanings.
c          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
c             t = tout (by overshooting and interpolating).
c          2  means take one step only and return.
c          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
c             beyond t = tout and return.
c          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
c             t = tout but without overshooting t = tcrit.
c             tcrit must be input as rwork(1).  tcrit may be equal to
c             or beyond tout, but not behind it in the direction of
c             integration.  this option is useful if the problem
c             has a singularity at or beyond t = tcrit.
c          5  means take one step, without passing tcrit, and return.
c             tcrit must be input as rwork(1).
c
c          note..  if itask = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches tcrit
c          (within roundoff), it will return t = tcrit (exactly) to
c          indicate this (unless itask = 4 and tout comes before tcrit,
c          in which case answers at t = tout are returned first).
c
c istate = an index used for input and output to specify the
c          state of the calculation.
c
c          on input, the values of istate are as follows.
c          0  means this is the first call for the problem, and
c             lsodi is to compute the initial value of dy/dt
c             (while doing other initializations).  see note below.
c          1  means this is the first call for the problem, and
c             the initial value of dy/dt has been supplied in
c             ydoti (lsodi will do other initializations). see note
c             below.
c          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
c             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
c             parameters except possibly tout and itask.
c             (if itol, rtol, and/or atol are changed between calls
c             with istate = 2, the new values will be used but not
c             tested for legality.)
c          3  means this is not the first call, and the
c             calculation is to continue normally, but with
c             a change in input parameters other than
c             tout and itask.  changes are allowed in
c             neq, itol, rtol, atol, iopt, lrw, liw, mf, ml, mu,
c             and any of the optional inputs except h0.
c             (see iwork description for ml and mu.)
c          note..  a preliminary call with tout = t is not counted
c          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
c          input is done.  (such a call is sometimes useful for the
c          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
c          thus the first call for which tout .ne. t requires
c          istate = 0 or 1 on input.
c
c          on output, istate has the following values and meanings.
c           0 or 1  means nothing was done, as tout was equal to t with
c              istate = 0 or 1 on input.  (however, an internal counter
c              was set to detect and prevent repeated calls of this
c              type. )
c           2  means that the integration was performed successfully.
c           3  means that the user-supplied subroutine res signalled
c              lsodi to halt the integration and return (ires=2).
c              integration as far as t was achieved with no occurrence
c              of ires=2, but this flag was set on attempting the next
c              step.
c          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than mxstep
c              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
c              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
c              successful as far as t.  (mxstep is an optional input
c              and is normally 500.)  to continue, the user may
c              simply reset istate to a value .gt. 1 and call again
c              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
c              in addition, the user may increase mxstep to avoid
c              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
c          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
c              of the machine being used.  this was detected before
c              completing the requested task, but the integration
c              was successful as far as t.  to continue, the tolerance
c              parameters must be reset, and istate must be set
c              to 3.  the optional output tolsf may be used for this
c              purpose.  (note.. if this condition is detected before
c              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
c              (istate = -3) occurs instead.)
c          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
c              integration steps.  see written message for details.
c              note..  if the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
c              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
c              the run to stop.
c          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
c              one attempted step, before completing the requested
c              task, but the integration was successful as far as t.
c              the problem may have a singularity, or the input
c              may be inappropriate.
c          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
c              one attempted step, before completing the requested
c              task, but the integration was successful as far as t.
c              this may be caused by an inaccurate jacobian matrix.
c          -6  means ewt(i) became zero for some i during the
c              integration.  pure relative error control (atol(i)=0.0)
c              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
c              the integration was successful as far as t.
c          -7  means that the user-supplied subroutine res set
c              its error flag (ires = 3) despite repeated tries by
c              lsodi to avoid that condition.
c          -8  means that istate was 0 on input but lsodi was unable
c              to compute the initial value of dy/dt.  see the
c              printed message for details.
c
c          note..  since the normal output value of istate is 2,
c          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
c          similarly, istate need not be reset if res told lsodi
c          to return because the calling program must change
c          the parameters of the problem.
c          also, since a negative input value of istate will be
c          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
c          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
c          calling the solver again.
c
c iopt   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
c          inputs are being used on this call.  input only.
c          the optional inputs are listed separately below.
c          iopt = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
c                   default values will be used in all cases.
c          iopt = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
c
c rwork  = a real working array (double precision).
c          the length of rwork must be at least
c             20 + nyh*(maxord + 1) + 3*neq + lenwm    where
c          nyh    = the initial value of neq,
c          maxord = 12 (if meth = 1) or 5 (if meth = 2) (unless a
c                   smaller value is given as an optional input),
c          lenwm   = neq**2 + 2    if miter is 1 or 2, and
c          lenwm   = (2*ml+mu+1)*neq + 2 if miter is 4 or 5.
c          (see mf description for the definition of meth and miter.)
c          thus if maxord has its default value and neq is constant,
c          this length is
c             22 + 16*neq + neq**2         for mf = 11 or 12,
c             22 + 17*neq + (2*ml+mu)*neq  for mf = 14 or 15,
c             22 +  9*neq + neq**2         for mf = 21 or 22,
c             22 + 10*neq + (2*ml+mu)*neq  for mf = 24 or 25.
c          the first 20 words of rwork are reserved for conditional
c          and optional inputs and optional outputs.
c
c          the following word in rwork is a conditional input..
c            rwork(1) = tcrit = critical value of t which the solver
c                       is not to overshoot.  required if itask is
c                       4 or 5, and ignored otherwise.  (see itask.)
c
c lrw    = the length of the array rwork, as declared by the user.
c          (this will be checked by the solver.)
c
c iwork  = an integer work array.  the length of iwork must be at least
c          20 + neq .  the first few words of iwork are used for
c          conditional and optional inputs and optional outputs.
c
c          the following 2 words in iwork are conditional inputs..
c            iwork(1) = ml     these are the lower and upper
c            iwork(2) = mu     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
c                       matrices in the problem-- the jacobian dr/dy
c                       and the left-hand side matrix a. these half-
c                       bandwidths exclude the main diagonal, so
c                       the total bandwidth is ml + mu + 1 .
c                       the band is defined by the matrix locations
c                       (i,j) with i-ml .le. j .le. i+mu.  ml and mu
c                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ml,mu  .le. neq-1.
c                       these are required if miter is 4 or 5, and
c                       ignored otherwise.
c                       ml and mu may in fact be the band parameters for
c                       matrices to which dr/dy and a are only
c                       approximately equal.
c
c liw    = the length of the array iwork, as declared by the user.
c          (this will be checked by the solver.)
c
c note..  the work arrays must not be altered between calls to lsodi
c for the same problem, except possibly for the conditional and
c optional inputs, and except for the last 3*neq words of rwork.
c the latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
c available for use by the user outside lsodi between calls, if
c desired (but not for use by res, adda, or jac).
c
c mf     = the method flag.  used only for input.  the legal values of
c          mf are 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 24, and 25.
c          mf has decimal digits meth and miter.. mf = 10*meth + miter.
c            meth indicates the basic linear multistep method..
c              meth = 1 means the implicit adams method.
c              meth = 2 means the method based on backward
c                       differentiation formulas (bdf-s).
c                the bdf method is strongly preferred for stiff prob-
c              lems, while the adams method is preferred when the prob-
c              lem is not stiff. if the matrix a(t,y) is nonsingular,
c              stiffness here can be taken to mean that of the explicit
c              ode system dy/dt = a**(-1) * g.  if a is singular, the
c              concept of stiffness is not well defined.
c                if you do not know whether the problem is stiff, we
c              recommend using meth = 2.  if it is stiff, the advan-
c              tage of meth = 2 over 1 will be great, while if it is
c              not stiff, the advantage of meth = 1 will be slight.
c              if maximum efficiency is important, some experimentation
c              with meth may be necessary.
c            miter indicates the corrector iteration method..
c              miter = 1 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
c                        full (neq by neq) jacobian.
c              miter = 2 means chord iteration with an internally
c                        generated (difference quotient) full jacobian.
c                        this uses neq+1 extra calls to res per dr/dy
c                        evaluation.
c              miter = 4 means chord iteration with a user-supplied
c                        banded jacobian.
c              miter = 5 means chord iteration with an internally
c                        generated banded jacobian (using ml+mu+2
c                        extra calls to res per dr/dy evaluation).
c              if miter = 1 or 4, the user must supply a subroutine jac
c              (the name is arbitrary) as described above under jac.
c              for other values of miter, a dummy argument can be used.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c optional inputs.
c
c the following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
c call sequence.  (see also part ii.)  for each such input variable,
c this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
c location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
c the use of any of these inputs requires iopt = 1, and in that
c case all of these inputs are examined.  a value of zero for any
c of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
c thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
c locations 5 to 10 in rwork and iwork to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
c then set those of interest to nonzero values.
c
c name    location      meaning and default value
c
c h0      rwork(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
c                   the default value is determined by the solver.
c
c hmax    rwork(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
c                   the default value is infinite.
c
c hmin    rwork(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
c                   the default value is 0.  (this lower bound is not
c                   enforced on the final step before reaching tcrit
c                   when itask = 4 or 5.)
c
c maxord  iwork(5)  the maximum order to be allowed.  the default
c                   value is 12 if meth = 1, and 5 if meth = 2.
c                   if maxord exceeds the default value, it will
c                   be reduced to the default value.
c                   if maxord is changed during the problem, it may
c                   cause the current order to be reduced.
c
c mxstep  iwork(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
c                   allowed during one call to the solver.
c                   the default value is 500.
c
c mxhnil  iwork(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
c                   warning that t + h = t on a step (h = step size).
c                   this must be positive to result in a non-default
c                   value.  the default value is 10.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c optional outputs.
c
c as optional additional output from lsodi, the variables listed
c below are quantities related to the performance of lsodi
c which are available to the user.  these are communicated by way of
c the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
c except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
c on any successful return from lsodi, and on any return with
c istate = -1, -2, -4, -5, -6, or -7. on a return with -3 (illegal
c input) or -8, they will be unchanged from their existing values
c (if any), except possibly for tolsf, lenrw, and leniw.
c on any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
c as noted below.
c
c name    location      meaning
c
c hu      rwork(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
c
c hcur    rwork(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
c
c tcur    rwork(13) the current value of the independent variable
c                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
c                   current internal mesh point in t.  on output, tcur
c                   will always be at least as far as the argument
c                   t, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
c
c tolsf   rwork(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
c                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
c                   detected (istate = -3 if detected at the start of
c                   the problem, istate = -2 otherwise).  if itol is
c                   left unaltered but rtol and atol are uniformly
c                   scaled up by a factor of tolsf for the next call,
c                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
c                   (the user may also ignore tolsf and alter the
c                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
c
c nst     iwork(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
c
c nre     iwork(12) the number of residual evaluations (res calls)
c                   for the problem so far.
c
c nje     iwork(13) the number of jacobian evaluations (each involving
c                   an evaluation of a and dr/dy) for the problem so
c                   far.  this equals the number of calls to adda and
c                   (if miter = 1 or 4) jac, and the number of matrix
c                   l-u decompositions.
c
c nqu     iwork(14) the method order last used (successfully).
c
c nqcur   iwork(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
c
c imxer   iwork(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
c                   the weighted local error vector ( e(i)/ewt(i) ),
c                   on an error return with istate = -4 or -5.
c
c lenrw   iwork(17) the length of rwork actually required.
c                   this is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
c                   input return for insufficient storage.
c
c leniw   iwork(18) the length of iwork actually required.
c                   this is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
c                   input return for insufficient storage.
c
c
c the following two arrays are segments of the rwork array which
c may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
c for each array, the table below gives its internal name,
c its base address in rwork, and its description.
c
c name    base address      description
c
c yh      21             the nordsieck history array, of size nyh by
c                        (nqcur + 1), where nyh is the initial value
c                        of neq.  for j = 0,1,...,nqcur, column j+1
c                        of yh contains hcur**j/factorial(j) times
c                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
c                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
c                        evaluated at t = tcur.
c
c acor     lenrw-neq+1   array of size neq used for the accumulated
c                        corrections on each step, scaled on output to
c                        represent the estimated local error in y on the
c                        last step. this is the vector e in the descrip-
c                        tion of the error control.  it is defined only
c                        on a return from lsodi with istate = 2.
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part ii.  other routines callable.
c
c the following are optional calls which the user may make to
c gain additional capabilities in conjunction with lsodi.
c (the routines xsetun and xsetf are designed to conform to the
c slatec error handling package.)
c
c     form of call                  function
c   call xsetun(lun)          set the logical unit number, lun, for
c                             output of messages from lsodi, if
c                             the default is not desired.
c                             the default value of lun is 6.
c
c   call xsetf(mflag)         set a flag to control the printing of
c                             messages by lsodi.
c                             mflag = 0 means do not print. (danger..
c                             this risks losing valuable information.)
c                             mflag = 1 means print (the default).
c
c                             either of the above calls may be made at
c                             any time and will take effect immediately.
c
c   call srcom(rsav,isav,job) saves and restores the contents of
c                             the internal common blocks used by
c                             lsodi (see part iii below).
c                             rsav must be a real array of length 218
c                             or more, and isav must be an integer
c                             array of length 41 or more.
c                             job=1 means save common into rsav/isav.
c                             job=2 means restore common from rsav/isav.
c                                srcom is useful if one is
c                             interrupting a run and restarting
c                             later, or alternating between two or
c                             more problems solved with lsodi.
c
c   call intdy(,,,,,)         provide derivatives of y, of various
c        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
c                             desired.  it may be called only after
c                             a successful return from lsodi.
c
c the detailed instructions for using intdy are as follows.
c the form of the call is..
c
c   call intdy (t, k, rwork(21), nyh, dky, iflag)
c
c the input parameters are..
c
c t         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
c             (normally the same as the t last returned by lsodi).
c             for valid results, t must lie between tcur - hu and tcur.
c             (see optional outputs for tcur and hu.)
c k         = integer order of the derivative desired.  k must satisfy
c             0 .le. k .le. nqcur, where nqcur is the current order
c             (see optional outputs).  the capability corresponding
c             to k = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
c             by lsodi directly.  since nqcur .ge. 1, the first
c             derivative dy/dt is always available with intdy.
c rwork(21) = the base address of the history array yh.
c nyh       = column length of yh, equal to the initial value of neq.
c
c the output parameters are..
c
c dky       = a real array of length neq containing the computed value
c             of the k-th derivative of y(t).
c iflag     = integer flag, returned as 0 if k and t were legal,
c             -1 if k was illegal, and -2 if t was illegal.
c             on an error return, a message is also written.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part iii.  common blocks.
c
c if lsodi is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
c must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in..
c   (1) the call sequence to lsodi,
c   (2) the two internal common blocks
c         /ls0001/  of length  257  (218 double precision words
c                         followed by 39 integer words),
c         /eh0001/  of length  2 (integer words).
c
c if lsodi is used on a system in which the contents of internal
c common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
c declare the above two common blocks in his main program to insure
c that their contents are preserved.
c
c if the solution of a given problem by lsodi is to be interrupted
c and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
c or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
c following the return from the last lsodi call prior to the
c interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
c internal common blocks, and later restore these values before the
c next lsodi call for that problem.  to save and restore the common
c blocks, use subroutine srcom (see part ii above).
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part iv.  optionally replaceable solver routines.
c
c below are descriptions of two routines in the lsodi package which
c relate to the measurement of errors.  either routine can be
c replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  however, since such
c a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
c done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
c (note.. the means by which the package version of a routine is
c superseded by the user-s version may be system-dependent.)
c
c (a) ewset.
c the following subroutine is called just before each internal
c integration step, and sets the array of error weights, ewt, as
c described under itol/rtol/atol above..
c     subroutine ewset (neq, itol, rtol, atol, ycur, ewt)
c where neq, itol, rtol, and atol are as in the lsodi call sequence,
c ycur contains the current dependent variable vector, and
c ewt is the array of weights set by ewset.
c
c if the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in ewt(i)
c (i = 1,...,neq) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
c in y(i) to.  the ewt array returned by ewset is passed to the
c vnorm routine (see below), and also used by lsodi in the computation
c of the optional output imxer, the diagonal jacobian approximation,
c and the increments for difference quotient jacobians.
c
c in the user-supplied version of ewset, it may be desirable to use
c the current values of derivatives of y.  derivatives up to order nq
c are available from the history array yh, described above under
c optional outputs.  in ewset, yh is identical to the ycur array,
c extended to nq + 1 columns with a column length of nyh and scale
c factors of h**j/factorial(j).  on the first call for the problem,
c given by nst = 0, nq is 1 and h is temporarily set to 1.0.
c the quantities nq, nyh, h, and nst can be obtained by including
c in ewset the statements..
c     double precision h, rls
c     common /ls0001/ rls(218),ils(39)
c     nq = ils(35)
c     nyh = ils(14)
c     nst = ils(36)
c     h = rls(212)
c thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
c ycur(nyh+i)/h  (i=1,...,neq)  (and the division by h is
c unnecessary when nst = 0).
c
c (b) vnorm.
c the following is a real function routine which computes the weighted
c root-mean-square norm of a vector v..
c     d = vnorm (n, v, w)
c where..
c   n = the length of the vector,
c   v = real array of length n containing the vector,
c   w = real array of length n containing weights,
c   d = sqrt( (1/n) * sum(v(i)*w(i))**2 ).
c vnorm is called with n = neq and with w(i) = 1.0/ewt(i), where
c ewt is as set by subroutine ewset.
c
c if the user supplies this function, it should return a non-negative
c value of vnorm suitable for use in the error control in lsodi.
c none of the arguments should be altered by vnorm.
c for example, a user-supplied vnorm routine might..
c   -substitute a max-norm of (v(i)*w(i)) for the rms-norm, or
c   -ignore some components of v in the norm, with the effect of
c    suppressing the error control on those components of y.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c other routines in the lsodi package.
c
c in addition to subroutine lsodi, the lsodi package includes the
c following subroutines and function routines..
c  ainvg    computes the initial value of the vector
