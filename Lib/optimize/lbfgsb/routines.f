c     Subroutine setulb
c
c     This subroutine partitions the working arrays wa and iwa, and 
c       then uses the limited memory BFGS method to solve the bound
c       constrained optimization problem by calling mainlb.
c       (The direct method will be used in the subspace minimization.)

c       On entry nbd represents the type of bounds imposed on the

c         stores the remaining elements in the form of a heap.
c
c     iorder is an integer array of dimension n.
c       On entry iorder(i) is the index of t(i).
c       On exit iorder(i) is still the index of t(i), but iorder may be
c         permuted in accordance with t.
c
c     iheap is an integer variable specifying the task.
c       On entry iheap should be set as follows:

c
c     Subroutine subsm
c
c     Given xcp, l, u, r, an index set that specifies
c	the active set at xcp, and an l-BFGS matrix B 
c	(in terms of WY, WS, SY, WT, head, col, and theta), 
c	this subroutine computes an approximate solution
c	of the subspace problem

c	along the subspace unconstrained Newton direction 
c	
c	   d = -(Z'BZ)^(-1) r.
c
c       The formula for the Newton direction, given the L-BFGS matrix
c       and the Sherman-Morrison formula, is
c
c	   d = (1/theta)r + (1/theta*2) Z'WK^(-1)W'Z r.

c                     [L_a -R_z           theta*S'AA'S ]
c
c     Note that this procedure for computing d differs 
c     from that described in [1]. One can show that the matrix K is
c     equal to the matrix M^[-1]N in that paper.
c
c     n is an integer variable.
c       On entry n is the dimension of the problem.
c       On exit n is unchanged.
c
c     m is an integer variable.
c       On entry m is the maximum number of variable metric corrections
c         used to define the limited memory matrix.
c       On exit m is unchanged.
c
c     nsub is an integer variable.
c       On entry nsub is the number of free variables.
c       On exit nsub is unchanged.
c
c     ind is an integer array of dimension nsub.

c       On entry u is the upper bound of x.
c       On exit u is unchanged.
c
c     nbd is a integer array of dimension n.
c       On entry nbd represents the type of bounds imposed on the
c         variables, and must be specified as follows:
c         nbd(i)=0 if x(i) is unbounded,
c                1 if x(i) has only a lower bound,
c                2 if x(i) has both lower and upper bounds, and
c                3 if x(i) has only an upper bound.
c       On exit nbd is unchanged.
c
c     x is a double precision array of dimension n.
c       On entry x specifies the Cauchy point xcp. 
c       On exit x(i) is the minimizer of Q over the subspace of

c       On entry d is the reduced gradient of Q at xcp.
c       On exit d is the Newton direction of Q. 
c
c     ws and wy are double precision arrays;
c     theta is a double precision variable;
c     col is an integer variable;
c     head is an integer variable.

c                                          limited memory BFGS matrix:
c         ws(n,m) stores S, a set of s-vectors;
c         wy(n,m) stores Y, a set of y-vectors;
c         theta is the scaling factor specifying B_0 = theta I;
c         col is the number of variable metric corrections stored;

c       On entry iword is unspecified.
c       On exit iword specifies the status of the subspace solution.
c         iword = 0 if the solution is in the box,

c
c     wv is a double precision working array of dimension 2m.
c
c     wn is a double precision array of dimension 2m x 2m.

c       On exit wn is unchanged.
c
c     iprint is an INTEGER variable that must be set by the user.
c       It controls the frequency and type of output generated:
c        iprint<0    no output is generated;
c        iprint=0    print only one line at the last iteration;
c        0<iprint<99 print also f and |proj g| every iprint iterations;

c
c     Subroutine dcsrch
c
c     This subroutine finds a step that satisfies a sufficient
c     decrease condition and a curvature condition.
c
c     Each call of the subroutine updates an interval with 
c     endpoints stx and sty. The interval is initially chosen 
c     so that it contains a minimizer of the modified function
c
c           psi(stp) = f(stp) - f(0) - ftol*stp*f'(0).
c
c     If psi(stp) <= 0 and f'(stp) >= 0 for some step, then the
c     interval is chosen so that it contains a minimizer of f. 
c
c     The algorithm is designed to find a step that satisfies 
c     the sufficient decrease condition 
c
c           f(stp) <= f(0) + ftol*stp*f'(0),
c
c     and the curvature condition
c
c           abs(f'(stp)) <= gtol*abs(f'(0)).
c
c     If ftol is less than gtol and if, for example, the function
c     is bounded below, then there is always a step which satisfies
c     both conditions. 
c
c     If no step can be found that satisfies both conditions, then 
c     the algorithm stops with a warning. In this case stp only 
c     satisfies the sufficient decrease condition.
c
c     A typical invocation of dcsrch has the following outline:
c
c     task = 'START'
c  10 continue
c        call dcsrch( ... )
c        if (task .eq. 'FG') then
c           Evaluate the function and the gradient at stp 
c           goto 10
c           end if
c
c     NOTE: The user must no alter work arrays between calls.
c
c     The subroutine statement is
c
c        subroutine dcsrch(f,g,stp,ftol,gtol,xtol,stpmin,stpmax,
c                          task,isave,dsave)
c     where
c
c       f is a double precision variable.
c         On initial entry f is the value of the function at 0.
c            On subsequent entries f is the value of the 
c            function at stp.
c         On exit f is the value of the function at stp.
c
c	g is a double precision variable.
c         On initial entry g is the derivative of the function at 0.
c            On subsequent entries g is the derivative of the 
c            function at stp.
c         On exit g is the derivative of the function at stp.
c
c	stp is a double precision variable. 
c         On entry stp is the current estimate of a satisfactory 
c            step. On initial entry, a positive initial estimate 
c            must be provided. 
c         On exit stp is the current estimate of a satisfactory step
c            if task = 'FG'. If task = 'CONV' then stp satisfies
c            the sufficient decrease and curvature condition.
c
c       ftol is a double precision variable.
c         On entry ftol specifies a nonnegative tolerance for the 
c            sufficient decrease condition.
c         On exit ftol is unchanged.
c
c       gtol is a double precision variable.
c         On entry gtol specifies a nonnegative tolerance for the 
c            curvature condition. 
c         On exit gtol is unchanged.
c
c	xtol is a double precision variable.
c         On entry xtol specifies a nonnegative relative tolerance
c            for an acceptable step. The subroutine exits with a
c            warning if the relative difference between sty and stx
c            is less than xtol.
c         On exit xtol is unchanged.
c
c	stpmin is a double precision variable.
c         On entry stpmin is a nonnegative lower bound for the step.
c         On exit stpmin is unchanged.
c
c	stpmax is a double precision variable.
c         On entry stpmax is a nonnegative upper bound for the step.
c         On exit stpmax is unchanged.
c
c       task is a character variable of length at least 60.
c         On initial entry task must be set to 'START'.
c         On exit task indicates the required action:
c
c            If task(1:2) = 'FG' then evaluate the function and 
c            derivative at stp and call dcsrch again.
c
c            If task(1:4) = 'CONV' then the search is successful.
c
c            If task(1:4) = 'WARN' then the subroutine is not able
c            to satisfy the convergence conditions. The exit value of
c            stp contains the best point found during the search.
c
c            If task(1:5) = 'ERROR' then there is an error in the
c            input arguments.
c
c         On exit with convergence, a warning or an error, the
c            variable task contains additional information.
