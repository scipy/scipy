        The classic Brent routine to find a zero of the function

        It is a safe version of the secant method that uses inverse
        quadratic extrapolation. The version here is a slight
        modification that uses a different formula in the extrapolation
        step. A description may be found in Numerical Recipes, but the
        code here is probably easier to understand.

        A variation on the classic Brent routine to find a zero

        hyperbolic extrapolation instead of inverse quadratic
        extrapolation. There was a paper back in the 1980's ...

        par with the brent routine, but not as heavily tested.
