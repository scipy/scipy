Welcome  to SPARSKIT  VERSION  2.  SPARSKIT is  a  package of  FORTRAN
subroutines  for working  with  sparse matrices.  It includes  general
sparse  matrix  manipulation  routines  as  well as  a  few  iterative
solvers, see detailed description of contents below.

            S P A R S K I T   VERSION 2  
---------------------------------------------------

In this directory you will  find  all relevant subdirectories and  the
Unix makefile which  will  compile all the   modules and make  a  unix
library  libskit.a.   Please read  the makefile.    Making the library
should be  the first thing  to do  when starting  to use  the package.
Some  of  the    objects   will be  linked    into  a  library  called
libskit.a. Others   will  not be  linked  but  can be used    by other
makefiles for test  problems provided in  the subdirectories.  You can
then  link    to  libskit.a  by   default  instead  of  the individual
modules. (Please report   any  compilation problems or  (even   minor)
warnings  immediatly to saad@cs.umn.edu). Once  this   is done, it  is
recommended to run the test problems provided.  There are various test
suites in  each of the subdirectories  and makefiles are available for
each.     See  explanations in the   README   files in each individual
subdirectory.

You may also make and run  the test programs  using the dotests script
provided in this directory.  Output from this script may be redirected
into a file and compared to the sample output files out.xxx.  There is
an  additional  script called sgrep  which  is  useful for looking for
tools   in   all  the  subdirectories.    Read  the   sgrep  file  for
instructions.

 Here is some information on the SPARSKIT sub-directories.

 BLASSM : Basic linear algebra with sparse matrices. 
	  contains two modules: blassm.f and matvec.f

 DOC    : contains the main documentation of the package

 INFO   : information routine (new one) . Info2 (spectral 
	  information) not available yet.

 FORMATS: Contains the Format Conversion routines in
	  formats.f and the manipulation routines in
	  unary.f           

 INOUT  : input output routines. contains the module inout.f

 ITSOL  : contains the iterative solution package. Various 
          iterative solvers and preconditioners are provided. 

 MATGEN : matrix generation routines.
	  contains the module genmat.f and several subroutines 
	  called by it. Also contains zlatev.f (contributed
	  by E. Rothman, from Cornell).
 
 ORDERINGS: 
          still in the works. But contains a few coloring routines 
          and level-set related orderings -- (e.g., cuthill Mc Kee, etc.) 

 UNSUPP : various `unsupported' routines and drivers.
	  (misc. routines includind routines for 
          plotting.. BLAS1 is also added for completeness) 

 See the file "logfile" for a complete revision history.
