TODO
This list contains a number of things which need fixing and/or
improvement.  There's also a small explanatory
note with ideas.  More info is often contained in FIXMEs
at appropriate places in the code.


**include license for FITPACK
    take it from scipy.interpolate.


**handle smoothing in fitpack_wrapper
    The default smoothing parameter (s) means we aren't actually
    doing interpolation.  Also, small but non-zero s makes the
    algorithm very slow.  Figure out how to handle this, prob by
    not letting the user see s and setting it to 0.

    Then again, users very often want to smooth data at the same
    time.  FITPACK suffers from VERY slow performance when s
    is very small but not 0.  This is a problem.


**pick best spline
    Under-the-hood machinery currently comes from _interpolate.cpp
    (used in enthought.interpolate) and FITPACK (Fortran, used in 
    scipy.interpolate).  This isn't necessarily the best (for example,
    speed of FITPACK is highly sensitive to smoothing parameter s).  Other code
    is used in scipy.ndimage and scipy.signal.  There is surely other
    code out there too.  Figure out what is best and incorporate it.

    Signal code is slower than FITPACK, and NDImage requires a
    regular grid.  I'm inclined to stay with FITPACK, except for the
    slow performance when x is small (we could add a hack to not
    let s be tiny > 0).


**clean up fitpack_wrapper.py
    Currently is all hacked together from scipy.interpolate.
    There is unused functionality, commented-out functionality,
    and other undesirables.  Once it has been established what
    we will include, that stuff needs to be cleaned up, and the
    rest needs to be either removed or set aside.


**comment interpolate1d
    There's comments there already, but they should be
    made better.  Plus, features are changing, which requires
    updating the documentation.


**doc strings for interpolate1d and its members
    There's docstrings there already, but they should be
    made better.  In particular, it must be ensured that
    they are of the proper format and include examples.

    The doc strings for __init__.py, interpolate1d.py,
    Interpolate1d, and interp1d are virtually identical
    and very long; perhaps a master string can be stored
    somewhere that they all reference.  This would make
    updates of documentation easier.


**figure out NumPy stuff with vectorize.
    In function interpolate1d.__call__
    It would be nice to remove the hack I used.
    I believe vectorize is supposed to handle arrays of
    length 0, but it's not working on my computer.


**better handling of variable types
    Currently everything is cast to a float64 if it is not already
    a float32.  Is this the best way to do it?

    Also, for the future, code should be added for record arrays,
    which mix real values with strings.  This is, I believe already
    largely supported, but that's not because the code was written
    with that in mind.  I haven't thought through the details.

    Perhaps this should be done as another function/class which 
    wraps interpolate1d.


**improve regression tests
    desired for fitpack_wrapper and _interpolate_wrapper
    as well as interpolate1d.


**high-level road map
    when the module is more established, there should be a page on
    the wiki which describes the big-picture of the module; what
    the capabilities are and which should be added, large-scale
    architecture of the module, etc.

    It might note which underlying C/Fortran modules can or should
    be modified or merged.  It would be great if either 1) there were
    only 1 extension module, or 2) the modules showed natural
    differentiation of functionality (one for splines, one for simple
    operations, etc), rather than being a holdover of where they
    were stolen from.


**update for 2D and ND
    This will probably take the form of two additional
    classes both based on interpolate1d.  Thus it probably
    shouldn't be done until interpolate1d is more settled.
    
    There is an interesting problem here.  Most of the extensions
    I have assume a regular grid.  First off, this is often not general.
    Secondly, if I DO use a regular grid, how do I deal with bad
    data?  The best way is probably a pre-processing where you
    interpolate values for the bad points (linear would be a nice simple
    way to do it at first, just to get it working)


**allow y to be 2-dimensional?
    It is not decided whether this feature should be supported, but
    I don't think it should; I think there should be another class with
    that functionality which wraps Interpolate1d.  The main reasons
    are:
    1) interpolation should probably be along columns, so the user
    can enter data as enter the data as y=array([obs1, obs2, ...]).  But
    the interpolate_wrapper and fitpack_wrapper interpolate along
    rows; this means there would be messy transposes in the code.
    2) FITPACK doesn't support 2D y arrays, which means we would
    have to store the y columns separately
    3) If we remove bad data, bearing in mind (2), we would also
    have to store copies of x, since the bad data in the y cols aren't
    at the same locations, meaning that different data points should be
    deleted for each column.
