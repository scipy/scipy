TODO
This list contains a number of things which need fixing and/or
improvement.  There's also a small explanatory
note with ideas.  More info is often contained in FIXMEs
at appropriate places in the code.


**comment interpolate1d


**doc strings for interpolate1d and its members


**more strings user can pass ('cubic', etc)


**figure out NumPy version stuff with vectorize.
It would be nice to remove the hack I used.
I believe vectorize is supposed to handle arrays of
length 0, but it's not working on my computer.


**better handling of variable types
Currently everything is cast to a float64 if it is not already
a float32.  Is this the best way to do it?

Also, for the future, code should be added for record arrays,
which mix real values with strings.  This is, I believe already
largely supported, but that's not because the code was written
with that in mind.  I haven't thought through the details.

Perhaps this should be done as another function/class which 
wraps interpolate1d.


**allow y to be 2-dimensional
That way the interpolated function is from R1 -> Rn, and
not just R1 -> R1.  This requires some thinking about axes.


**write regression tests
desired for fitpack_wrapper and _interpolate_wrapper
as well as interpolate1d.  Recommend using the
shelve module


**pick best spline
Under-the-hood machinery currently comes from _interpolate.cpp
(used in enthought.interpolate) and FITPACK (Fortran, used in 
scipy.interpolate).  This isn't necessarily the best (for example,
speed of FITPACK is highly sensitive to parameter k).  Other code
is used in scipy.ndimage and scipy.signal.  There is surely other
code out there too.  Figure out what is best and incorporate it.


**update for 2D and ND
This will probably take the form of two additional
classes both based on interpolate1d.  Thus it probably
shouldn't be done until interpolate1d is more settled.
