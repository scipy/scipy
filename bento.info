Description:
    SciPy (pronounced "Sigh Pie") is open-source software for mathematics,
    science, and engineering. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which
    provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy
    library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly
    and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration
    and optimization.  Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are
    quick to install, and are free of charge.  NumPy and SciPy are easy to use,
    but powerful enough to be depended upon by some of the world's leading
    scientists and engineers. If you need to manipulate numbers on a computer
    and display or publish the results, give SciPy a try!
