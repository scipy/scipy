SciPy is an open source library of routines for science and engineering
using Python.  It is a community project sponsored by Enthought, Inc.
SciPy originated with code contributions by Travis Oliphant, Pearu
Peterson, and Eric Jones.  Travis Oliphant and Eric Jones each contributed
about half the initial code.  Pearu Peterson developed f2py, which is the
integral to wrapping the many Fortran libraries used in SciPy.

Since then many people have contributed to SciPy, both in code development,
suggestions, and financial support.  Below is a partial list.  If you've
been left off, please email the "SciPy Developers List" <scipy-dev@scipy.org>.
