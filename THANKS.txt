SciPy is an open source library of routines for science and engineering
using Python.  It is a community project sponsored by Enthought, Inc.
Many people have contributed to SciPy, both in code development,
suggestions, and financial support.  Below is a partial list.  If you've
been left off, please let me know (eric@enthought.com), and I'll add
your name.

Code Contributions:

The main developers on SciPy are Travis Oliphant, Pearu Peterson, and Eric 
Jones.  Travis and Eric each contributed about half the orginal code.  Pearu 
developed f2py, which is the integral to wrapping the many Fortran libraries 
used in SciPy.  All three continually work on both algorithm development and 
improvements to the feature set, build process, and robustness of SciPy.  

Please add names as needed so that we can keep up with all the contributors. 

Kumar Appaiah       -- Dolph Chebyshev window
Nathan Bell         -- sparsetools, help with scipy.sparse and scipy.splinalg
Robert Cimrman      -- UMFpack wrapper for sparse matrix module
David M. Cooke      -- improvements to system_info, and LBFGSB wrapper
Aric Hagberg        -- ARPACK wrappers, help with splinalg.eigen
Chuck Harris        -- Zeros package in optimize (1d root-finding algorithms)
Prabhu Ramachandran -- improvements to gui_thread
Robert Kern         -- improvements to stats and bug-fixes
Jean-Sebastien Roy  -- fmin_tnc code which he adapted from Stephen Nash's 
                       original Fortran
Ed Schofield        -- Maximum entropy and Monte Carlo modules, help with
                       sparse matrix module
Travis Vaught       -- initial work on stats module clean up
Jeff Whitaker       -- Mac OS X support
David Cournapeau    -- bug-fixes, refactor of fftpack and cluster, numscons build.
Damian Eads         -- hierarchical clustering, dendrogram plotting,
                       distance functions, vq documentation


Testing:

David Morrill for getting the scoreboard test system up and running.
Louis Luangkesorn for providing multiple tests for the stats module.


Others:

Others who have contributed in the past include:

Jochen Kupper -- the zoom feature in the now-deprecated plt plotting module


Website Development:

Travis Vaught, Tiffany Kamm, and Eric Jones -- for building the community web-site.
Travis Vaught, Mark Koudritsky -- for maintaining the web-site
Andrew Straw -- for setting up the new Wiki at scipy.org


Institutions:

Enthought -- for providing resources and finances for development of SciPy.
Brigham Young University -- for providing resources for students to work on SciPy.
Agilent -- which gave a genereous donation for support of SciPy.
