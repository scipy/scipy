Piecewise polynomials and splines
=================================

1D interpolation routines :ref:`discussed in the previous section
<tutorial-interpolate_1Dsection>`, work by constructing certain *piecewise
polynomials*: the interpolation range is split into intervals by the so-called
*breakpoints*, and there is a certain polynomial on each interval. These
polynomial pieces then match at the breakpoints with a predefined smoothness:
the second derivatives for cubic splines, the first derivatives for monotone
interpolants and so on.

A polynomial of degree :math:`k` can be thought of as a linear combination of
:math:`k+1` monomial basis elements, :math:`1, x, x^2, \cdots, x^k`. 
In some applications, it is useful to consider alternative (if formally
equivalent) bases. Two popular bases, implemented in `scipy.interpolate` are
B-splines (`BSpline`) and Bernstein polynomials (`BPoly`).
B-splines are often used for, for example, non-parametric regression problems,
and Bernstein polynomials are used for constructing Bezier curves.

`PPoly` objects represent piecewise polynomials in the 'usual' power basis.
This is the case for `CubicSpline` instances and monotone interpolants.
In general, `PPoly` objects can represent polynomials of 
arbitrary orders, not only cubics. For the data array ``x``, breakpoints are at
the data points, and the array of coefficients, ``c`` , define polynomials of
degree :math:`k`, such that ``c[i, j]`` is a coefficient for
``(x - x[j])**(k-i)`` on the segment between ``x[j]`` and ``x[j+1]`` .

`BSpline` objects represent B-spline functions --- linear combinations of
:ref:`b-spline basis elements <tutorial-interpolate_bspl_basis>`. 
These objects can be instantiated directly or constructed from data with the
`make_interp_spline` factory function.

Finally, Bernstein polynomials are represented as instances of the `BPoly` class.

All these classes implement a (mostly) similar interface, `PPoly` being the most
feature-complete. We next consider the main features of this interface and
discuss some details of the alternative bases for piecewise polynomials.


.. _tutorial-interpolate_ppoly:

Manipulating `PPoly` objects
============================

`PPoly` objects have convenient methods for constructing derivatives
and antiderivatives, computing integrals and root-finding. For example, we
tabulate the sine function and find the roots of its derivative.

    >>> from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 10, 71)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)
    >>> spl = CubicSpline(x, y)

Now, differentiate the spline:

    >>> dspl = spl.derivative()

Here ``dspl`` is a `PPoly` instance which represents a polynomial approximation
to the derivative of the original object, ``spl`` . Evaluating ``dspl`` at a
fixed argument is equivalent to evaluating the original spline with the ``nu=1``
argument:

    >>> dspl(1.1), spl(1.1, nu=1)
    (0.45361436, 0.45361436)

Note that the second form above evaluates the derivative in place, while with
the ``dspl`` object, we can find the zeros of the derivative of ``spl``:

    >>> dspl.roots() / np.pi
    array([-0.45480801,  0.50000034,  1.50000099,  2.5000016 ,  3.46249993])

This agrees well with roots :math:`\pi/2 + \pi\,n` of
:math:`\cos(x) = \sin'(x)`.
Note that by default it computed the roots *extrapolated* to the outside of
the interpolation interval :math:`0 \leqslant x \leqslant 10`, and that
the extrapolated results (the first and last values) are much less accurate.
We can switch off the extrapolation and limit the root-finding to the
interpolation interval:

    >>> dspl.roots(extrapolate=False) / np.pi
    array([0.50000034,  1.50000099,  2.5000016])

In fact, the ``root`` method is a special case of a more general ``solve``
method which finds for a given constant :math:`y` the solutions of the
equation :math:`f(x) = y` , where :math:`f(x)` is the piecewise polynomial:

    >>> dspl.solve(0.5, extrapolate=False) / np.pi
    array([0.33332755, 1.66667195, 2.3333271])

which agrees well with the expected values of  :math:`\pm\arccos(1/2) + 2\pi\,n`.

Integrals of piecewise polynomials can be computed using the ``.integrate``
method which accepts the lower and the upper limits of integration. As an
example, we compute an approximation to the complete elliptic integral
:math:`K(m) = \int_0^{\pi/2} [1 - m\sin^2 x]^{-1/2} dx`:

    >>> from scipy.special import ellipk
    >>> m = 0.5
    >>> ellipk(m)
    1.8540746773013719

To this end, we tabulate the integrand and interpolate it using the monotone
PCHIP interpolant (we could as well used a `CubicSpline`):

    >>> from scipy.interpolate import PchipInterpolator
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 70)
    >>> y = (1 - m*np.sin(x)**2))**(-1/2)
    >>> spl = PchipInterpolator(x, y)

and integrate

    >>> spl.integrate(0, np.pi/2)
    1.854074674965991

which is indeed close to the value computed by `scipy.special.ellipk`.

All piecewise polynomials can be constructed with N-dimensional ``y`` values.
If ``y.ndim > 1``, it is understood as a stack of 1D ``y`` values, which are
arranged along the interpolation axis (with the default value of 0).
The latter is specified via the ``axis`` argument, and the invariant is that
``len(x) == y.shape[axis]``. As an example, we extend the elliptic integral
example above to compute the approximation for a range of ``m`` values, using
the NumPy broadcasting:

.. plot::

    >>> from scipy.interpolate import PchipInterpolator
    >>> m = np.linspace(0, 0.9, 11)
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 70)
    >>> y = 1 / np.sqrt(1 - m[:, None]*np.sin(x)**2)

    Now the ``y`` array has the shape ``(11, 70)``, so that the values of ``y``
    for fixed value of ``m`` are along the second axis of the ``y`` array.

    >>> spl = PchipInterpolator(x, y, axis=1)  # the default is axis=0
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> plt.plot(m, spl.integrate(0, np.pi/2), '--')

    >>> from scipy.special import ellipk
    >>> plt.plot(m, ellipk(m), 'o')
    >>> plt.legend(['`ellipk`', 'integrated piecewise polynomial'])
    >>> plt.show()


B-splines: knots and coefficients
=================================

A b-spline function --- for instance, constructed from data via a
`make_interp_spline` call --- is defined by the so-called *knots* and coefficients.

As an illustration, let us again construct the interpolation of a sine function. 
The knots are available as the ``t`` attribute of a `BSpline` instance:

    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 3/2, 7)
    >>> y = np.sin(np.pi*x)
    >>> from scipy.interpolate import make_interp_spline
    >>> bspl = make_interp_spline(x, y, k=3)
    >>> print(bspl.t)
    [0.  0.  0.  0.        0.5  0.75  1.        1.5  1.5  1.5  1.5 ]
    >>> print(x)
    [            0.  0.25  0.5  0.75  1.  1.25  1.5 ]

We see that the knot vector by default is constructed from the input
array ``x``: first, it is made :math:`(k+1)` -regular (it has ``k``
repeated knots appended and prepended); then, the second and
second-to-last points of the input array are removed---this is the so-called
*not-a-knot* boundary condition. 

In general, an interpolating spline of degree ``k`` needs
``len(t) - len(x) - k - 1`` boundary conditions. For cubic splines with
``(k+1)``-regular knot arrays this means two boundary conditions---or
removing two values from the ``x`` array. Various boundary conditions can be
requested using the optional ``bc_type`` argument of `make_interp_spline`.

The b-spline coefficients are accessed via the ``c`` attribute of a `BSpline`
object:

    >>> len(bspl.c)
    7

The convention is that for ``len(t)`` knots there are ``len(t) - k - 1``
coefficients. Some routines (see the :ref:`Smoothing splines section
<tutorial-interpolate_fitpack>`) zero-pad the ``c`` arrays so that
``len(c) == len(t)``. These additional coefficients are ignored for evaluation.

We stress that the coefficients are given in the
:ref:`b-spline basis <tutorial-interpolate_bspl_basis>`, not the power basis
of :math:`1, x, \cdots, x^k`.


.. _tutorial-interpolate_bspl_basis:

B-spline basis elements
-----------------------

B-splines are piecewise polynomials, represented as linear combinations of
*b-spline basis elements* --- which themselves are certain linear combinations
of usual monomials, :math:`x^m` with :math:`m=0, 1, \dots, k`.

The b-spline basis is generally more computationally stable than the power basis
and is useful for a variety of applications which include interpolation, regression
and curve representation. The main feature is that these basis elements are
*localized* and equal to zero outside of an interval defined by the *knot array*.

Specifically, a b-spline basis element of degree ``k`` (e.g. ``k=3`` for cubics)
is defined by :math:`k+2` knots and is zero outside of these knots.
To illustrate, plot a collection of non-zero basis elements on a certain
interval:

.. plot ::

    >>> k = 3      # cubic splines
    >>> t = [0., 1.4, 2., 3.1, 5.]   # internal knots
    >>> t = np.r_[[0]*k, t, [5]*k]   # add boundary knots

    >>> from scipy.interpolate import BSpline
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> for j in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    ...     a, b = t[k+j], t[-k+j-1]
    ...     xx = np.linspace(a, b, 101)
    ...     bspl = BSpline.basis_element(t[k+j:-k+j])
    ...     plt.plot(xx, bspl(xx), label=f'j = {j}')
    >>> plt.legend(loc='best')
    >>> plt.show()

Here `BSpline.basis_element` is essentially a shorthand for constructing a spline
with only a single non-zero coefficient. For instance, the ``j=2`` element in
the above example is equivalent to

    >>> c = np.zeros(t.size - k - 1)
    >>> c[-2] = 1
    >>> b = BSpline(t, c, k)
    >>> np.allclose(b(xx), bspl(xx))
    True

If desired, a b-spline can be converted into a `PPoly` object using
`PPoly.from_spline` method which accepts a `BSpline` instance and returns a
`PPoly` instance. The reverse conversion is performed by the
`BSpline.from_power_basis` method. However, conversions between bases is best
avoided because it accumulates rounding errors.


.. _tutorial-interpolate_bspl_design_matrix:

Design matrices in the B-spline basis
-------------------------------------

One common application of b-splines is in non-parametric regression. The reason
is that the localized nature of the b-spline basis elements makes linear
algebra banded. This is because at most :math:`k+1` basis elements are non-zero
at a given evaluation point, thus a design matrix built on b-splines has at most
:math:`k+1` diagonals.

As an illustration, we consider a toy example. Suppose our data are
one-dimensional and are confined to an interval :math:`[0, 6]`.
We construct a 4-regular knot vector which corresponds to 7 data points and
cubic, `k=3`, splines:

>>> t = [0., 0., 0., 0., 2., 3., 4., 6., 6., 6., 6.]

Next, take 'observations' to be

>>> xnew = [1, 2, 3]

and construct the design matrix in the sparse CSR format

>>> from scipy.interpolate import BSpline
>>> mat = BSpline.design_matrix(xnew, t, k=3)
>>> mat
<3x7 sparse array of type '<class 'numpy.float64'>'
	with 12 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>

Here each row of the design matrix corresponds to a value in the ``xnew`` array,
and a row has no more than ``k+1 = 4`` non-zero elements; row ``j``
contains basis elements evaluated at ``xnew[j]``:

>>> with np.printoptions(precision=3):
...     print(mat.toarray())
[[0.125 0.514 0.319 0.042 0.    0.    0.   ]
 [0.    0.111 0.556 0.333 0.    0.    0.   ]
 [0.    0.    0.125 0.75  0.125 0.    0.   ]]
