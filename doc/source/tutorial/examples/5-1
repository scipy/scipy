   broyden1            --  Broyden's first method - is a quasi-Newton-Raphson
                           method for updating an approximate Jacobian and then
                           inverting it
   broyden2            --  Broyden's second method - the same as broyden1, but
                           updates the inverse Jacobian directly
   broyden3            --  Broyden's second method - the same as broyden2, but
                           instead of directly computing the inverse Jacobian,
                           it remembers how to construct it using vectors, and
                           when computing inv(J)*F, it uses those vectors to
                           compute this product, thus avoiding the expensive NxN
                           matrix multiplication.
   broyden_generalized --  Generalized Broyden's method, the same as broyden2,
                           but instead of approximating the full NxN Jacobian,
                           it construct it at every iteration in a way that
                           avoids the NxN matrix multiplication.  This is not
                           as precise as broyden3.
   anderson            --  extended Anderson method, the same as the
                           broyden_generalized, but added w_0^2*I to before
                           taking inversion to improve the stability
   anderson2           --  the Anderson method, the same as anderson, but
                           formulated differently
