    "# Solving differential algebraic equations\n",

    "Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs, see [1]) are in their most general form of the form:\n",
    "$$F\\left( \\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt}, \\mathbf{y}, t \\right) = 0 $$\n",
    "In most cases, DAEs may also be simplified to the following form:\n",
    "$$ M \\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}\\left(\\mathbf{y}, t \\right) $$\n",
    "where $M$ is the *mass matrix* of the system, here assumed to be constant.\n",
    "If $M$ is not singular, it is theoretically be possible to invert it and obtain the equivalent ODE system :\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = M^{-1} \\mathbf{f}\\left(\\mathbf{y}, t \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $M$ is singular, this operation is not possible. The singularity usually means that some components of the system do not have an explicitly prescribed time derivative, they are therefore referred to as *algebraic variables*. The other components are referred to as *differential variables*.\n",
    "In the case of a DAE, the algebraic variables must remain on a so-called *manifold*, which depends on the differential variables, such that the DAE is satisfied at all times.\n",
    "The DAE is usually qualified by its index (see pendulum tutorial TODO). The higher the index, the more difficult solving the problem usually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "DAEs often arise in physical modelling when some subprocess is considered to be infinitely faster than others.\n",
    "Some typical examples are the fixed-length pendulum (see tutorial TODO), rigid body mechanisms, or incompressible flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very good introductions to DAEs can be found in TODO Petzold], and more advanced topics are explored in  [Hairer] [Hairer Lubich] TODO.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numerical integration of DAEs is often much more complex that ODEs, and requires specific schemes.\n",
    "The 'Radau' scheme avaible via ``solve_ivp`` is well suited to the integration of DAEs up to index 3. DAEs formulated with a constant mass matrix can be solved in Scipy with ``solve_ivp``, by prescribing as additional arguments the mass matrix, and the index of each variable , and using ``method='Radau'``. Several optional parameters can be used to improve the robustness of the integration if necessary (see Radau doc TODO)\n",

    "In the case of a pendulum with a rod modelled as a spring of stiffness $k$ and resting length $r_0$, the equations of movement of the mass attached to the rod read, in the cartesian frame $(x,y)$ :\n",

    "It is well known that the time scale of the pendulum oscillation is on the order of $\\sqrt{{r_0}/{g}}$, while the time scale of the rod length oscillation is on the order of $\\sqrt{m/k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the spring stiffness increases, the rod length oscillates much more quickly than the angle of the pendulum does. The system becomes stiff. In the case of an extremely stiff pendulum, i.e. $k \\rightarrow \\infty$, the expected behaviour is that the rod length remains at an infinitesimal distance from $r_0$. Thus the equations of motion could be rearranged as :\n",

    "But here, the explicit formula for the rod force $T$ has been lost. It however appears in the momentum equations, thus has an indirect impact on the evolution of the pendulum mass positions $(x,y)$. The force $T$ must however evolve such that the rod length remains equal to $r_0$, as prescribed by the last equation. This equation is referred to as a *constraint*, and $T$ has become an algebraic variable.\n",

    "Many DAEs arise from similar considerations in physical modelling, when one process is assumed to occur instantaneously, or in time scales much shorter than the time scales of interest.\n",
    "A few typical examples include :\n",
    "    - Incompressible flows, which are obtained from the compressible flow equations, assuming that pressured wave propagate infinitely fast, leading to a permanent pressure equilibrium in the domain. By discarding this acoustic waves and the equation of state which links the pressure to the density and temperature, only the convective time scales need to be resolved, which typically permits the use of larger time steps. In the incrompressible model, the pressure field becomes an algebraic field which acts as a force field to ensure the velocity field remains divergence free. The overall system becomes a DAE of index 2.\n",
    "    - Rigid body mechanisms, of which the fixed-length pendulum is the simplest example, where the efforts are algebraic variables, usually of index 3.\n"
