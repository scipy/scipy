# SciPy Code of Conduct - Enforcement Manual

This is the enforcement manual followed by SciPy's Code of Conduct
Committee. It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent
and fair.

## The Code of Conduct Committee

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a Code of
Conduct Committee ("the committee"), currently comprised of
[*note:* still gathering volunteers, this will be filled in as they become
available and prior to final upload into the rendered site]:

* Person One foo@email (Chair of the Committee)
* ...
* Person Three bar@email

The SciPy Steering Council will approve the members of this three person
committee. The members will be drawn from our entire community, and we intend
that it *not* be only Steering Council members: anyone who is actively engaged
with SciPy can propose to join this committee (we'll explicitly solicit
volunteers when short of three members).  One member will be designated chair of
the group and will be responsible for all reports back to the Steering Council.


## Enforcement guidelines and principles

Enforcing the Code of Conduct impacts our community today and for the future.
It's an action that we do not take lightly. When reviewing enforcement
measures, the Code of Conduct Committee will keep the following values and
guidelines in mind:

* Act in a personal manner rather than impersonal.  The Committee can engage
  the parties to understand the situation, while respecting the privacy and any
  necessary confidentiality of reporters.  However, sometimes it is necessary
  to communicate with one or more individuals directly: the Committee's goal is
  to improve the health of our community rather than only produce a formal
  decision.

* Emphasize empathy for individuals rather than judging behavior, avoiding
  binary labels of "good" and "bad/evil". Overt, clear-cut aggression and
  harassment exists and will be addressed unambiguously.  But many scenarios
  that can prove challenging to resolve are those where normal disagreements
  devolve into inappropriate behavior from multiple parties.  Understanding the
  full context and finding a path that re-engages all is hard, but ultimately
  the most productive for our community.

* Help increase engagement in good discussion practice: try to identify where
  discussion may have broken down and provide actionable information, pointers
  and resources that can help enact positive change on these points.

* Be mindful of the needs of new members: provide them with explicit support
  and consideration, with the aim of increasing participation from
  underrepresented groups in particular.

* Individuals come from different cultural backgrounds and native languages.
  While lack of intent to harm is not an excuse, try to identify any honest
  misunderstandings caused by a non-native speaker and help them understand the
  issue and how to change.  Complex discussion in a foreign language can be
  very intimidating, and we want to grow our diversity also across
  nationalities and cultures.

* Our actions will reflect compassion for all individuals. We will seek to
  understand, to educate, and, as necessary, take action.


**Mediation:** voluntary, informal mediation is a tool at our disposal.  In
contexts such as when two or more parties have all escalated to the point of
inappropriate behavior (something sadly common in human conflict), it may be
useful to facilitate a mediation process. This is only an example: the
Committee can consider mediation in any case, mindful that the process is meant
to be strictly voluntary and no party can be pressured to participate. If the
Committee suggests mediation, it should:

* Find a candidate who can serve as a mediator.
* Obtain the agreement of the reporter(s). The reporter(s) have complete
  freedom to decline the mediation idea, or to propose an alternate mediator.
* Obtain the agreement of the reported person(s).
* Settle on the mediator: while parties can propose a different mediator than
  the suggested candidate, only if common agreement is reached on all terms can
  the process move forward.
* Establish a timeline for mediation to complete, ideally within two weeks.

The mediator will engage with all the parties and seek a resolution that is
satisfactory to all.  Upon completion, the mediator will provide a report
(vetted by all parties to the process) to the Committee, with recommendations
on further steps.  The Committee will then evaluate these results (whether
satisfactory resolution was achieved or not) and decide on any additional
action deemed necessary.


## How the committee will respond to reports

When a report is sent to the committee they will immediately reply to the
reporter to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 72 hours, and the
group should strive to respond much quicker than that.

See the [Reporting Guidelines](*reporting.md*) for details of
what reports should contain. If a report doesn't contain enough information, the
committee will obtain all relevant data before acting. The committee is
empowered to act on the Steering Council’s behalf in contacting any individuals
involved to get a more complete account of events.

The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their
ability:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
* Who are the responsible party(ies).
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone's
  physical safety.

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
group's deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. chat transcripts,
email discussions, recorded conference calls, summaries of voice conversations,
etc).

It is important to retain an archive of all activities of this committee to
ensure consistency in behavior and provide institutional memory for the
project.  To assist in this, the default channel of discussion for this
committee will be a private mailing list accessible to current and future
members of the committee as well as members of the Steering Council upon
justified request. If the Committee finds the need to use off-list
communications (e.g. phone calls for early/rapid response), it should in all
cases summarize these back to the list so there's a good record of the process.

The Code of Conduct Committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within
one week. In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, the
committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline
for resolution.


## Incident Response and Committee Actions

If the act is ongoing, or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of
violence), any committee member may act immediately (before reaching consensus)
to address the situation. In ongoing situations, any member may decide to employ
any of the tools available to the committee, including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the committee may -- and
should -- act unilaterally to protect the safety of those involved. This can
include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on
behalf of the SciPy Steering Council.

In situations where an individual committee member acts unilaterally, they must
report their actions to the committee for review within 24 hours.

At events where no Committee members may be present, an event organizer will act
as their delegate. They will forward any reports to the Committee, as well as a
summary of any action they may have taken during the event.


## Resolutions

The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group cannot reach
consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the group will turn the matter over to
the Steering Council for resolution.


Possible responses may include:

* Taking no further action
  - if we determine no violations have occurred.
  - if the matter has been resolved publicly while the committee was
    considering responses.
* Coordinating voluntary mediation: if all involved parties agree, the
  Committee may facilitate a mediation process as detailed above.
* Remind publicly, and point out that some behavior/actions/language have been
  judged inappropriate and why in the current context, or can but hurtful to
  some people, requesting the community to self-adjust.
* A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. In this
  case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over
  email, cc'ing the group.
* A public reprimand. In this case, the committee chair will deliver that
  reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred, within the limits of
  practicality. E.g., the original mailing list for an email violation, but
  for a chat room discussion where the person/context may be gone, they can be
  reached by other means. The group may choose to publish this message
  elsewhere for documentation purposes.
* A request for a public or private apology, assuming the reporter agrees to
  this idea: they may at their discretion refuse further contact with the
  violator. The chair will deliver this request. The committee may, if it
  chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for example, the group may ask a
  violator to apologize in order to retain one’s membership on a mailing list.
* A "mutually agreed upon hiatus" where the committee asks the individual to
  temporarily refrain from community participation. If the individual chooses
  not to take a temporary break voluntarily, the committee may issue a
  "mandatory cooling off period".
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all SciPy spaces (mailing lists,
  gitter.im, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such bans so that
  they may be reviewed in the future or otherwise maintained.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the committee will
contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the
proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this resolution is acceptable,
and must note feedback for the record. However, the committee is not required to
act on this feedback.

Finally, the committee will make a report to the SciPy Steering Council (as
well as the SciPy core team in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a
ban).

The committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public statements will
be made by the chair of the Code of Conduct Committee or the SciPy Steering
Council.


## Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest, a committee member must immediately
notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
