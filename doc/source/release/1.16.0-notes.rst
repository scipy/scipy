SciPy 1.16.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: SciPy 1.16.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 1.16.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and better
documentation. There have been a number of deprecations and API changes
in this release, which are documented below. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to this release, as there are a large number of bug-fixes and
optimizations. Before upgrading, we recommend that users check that
their own code does not use deprecated SciPy functionality (to do so,
run your code with ``python -Wd`` and check for ``DeprecationWarning`` s).
Our development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on the
1.16.x branch, and on adding new features on the main branch.

This release requires Python 3.11-3.13 and NumPy 1.26.4 or greater.

``scipy.cluster`` improvements
==============================


``scipy.differentiate`` improvements

``scipy.interpolate`` improvements

``scipy.linalg`` improvements

``scipy.ndimage`` improvements
==============================


``scipy.optimize`` improvements
===============================
- COBYLA was updated to use the new Python implementation from the
  `PRIMA <https://www.libprima.net>`_ package
  (Z. Zhang, Python implementation by N. Belakovski).
  As compared to the old Powell implementation, the new one results in fewer function
  evaluations on average, but it depends on the problem and for some
  problems it can result in more function evaluations or a less optimal
  result. For those cases the user can try modifying the initial and final
  trust region radii given by `rhobeg` and `tol` respectively. A larger `rhobeg`
  can help the algorithm take bigger steps initially, while a smaller `tol`
  can help it for keep going and find a better solution.


``scipy.signal`` improvements
=============================


``scipy.sparse`` improvements
=============================


``scipy.spatial`` improvements
==============================


``scipy.special`` improvements
