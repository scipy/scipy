SciPy 1.4.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. contents::

SciPy 1.4.0 is the culmination of 6 months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and better
documentation. There have been a number of deprecations and API changes
in this release, which are documented below. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to this release, as there are a large number of bug-fixes and
optimizations. Before upgrading, we recommend that users check that
their own code does not use deprecated SciPy functionality (to do so,
run your code with ``python -Wd`` and check for ``DeprecationWarning`` s).
Our development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on the
1.4.x branch, and on adding new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 3.5+ and NumPy >=1.13.3 (for Python 3.5, 3.6),
>=1.14.5 (for Python 3.7), >= 1.17.3 (for Python 3.8)

For running on PyPy, PyPy3 6.0+ and NumPy 1.15.0 are required.

Highlights of this release
--------------------------

- a new submodule, `scipy.fft`, now supersedes `scipy.fftpack`; this
  means support for ``long double`` transforms, faster multi-dimensional
  transforms, improved algorithm time complexity, release of the global
  interpreter lock, and control over threading behavior
- support for ``pydata/sparse`` arrays in `scipy.sparse.linalg`
- substantial improvement to the documentation and functionality of
  several `scipy.special` functions, and some new additions
- the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution has been added to
  `scipy.stats`
- an implementation of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm in
  `scipy.sparse.csgraph.maximum_flow`
- `scipy.spatial.SphericalVoronoi` now supports n-dimensional input, 
   has linear memory complexity, improved performance, and
   supports single-hemisphere generators


New features
============

Infrastructure
--------------
Documentation can now be built with ``runtests.py --doc``

A ``Dockerfile`` is now available in the ``scipy/scipy-dev`` repository to
facilitate getting started with SciPy development.

`scipy.constants` improvements
------------------------------
`scipy.constants` has been updated with the CODATA 2018 constants.


`scipy.fft` added
-----------------
`scipy.fft` is a new submodule that supersedes the `scipy.fftpack` submodule. 
For the most part, this is a drop-in replacement for ``numpy.fft`` and 
`scipy.fftpack` alike. With some important differences, `scipy.fft`:
- uses NumPy's conventions for real transforms (``rfft``). This means the 
return value is a complex array, half the size of the full ``fft`` output.
This is different from the output of ``fftpack`` which returned a real array 
representing complex components packed together.
- the inverse real to real transforms (``idct`` and ``idst``) are normalized 
for ``norm=None`` in the same way as ``ifft``. This means the identity 
``idct(dct(x)) == x`` is now ``True`` for all norm modes.
- does not include the convolutions or pseudo-differential operators
from ``fftpack``.

This submodule is based on the ``pypocketfft`` library, developed by the 
author of ``pocketfft`` which was recently adopted by NumPy as well.
``pypocketfft`` offers a number of advantages over fortran ``FFTPACK``:
- support for long double (``np.longfloat``) precision transforms.
- faster multi-dimensional transforms using vectorisation
- Bluestein’s algorithm removes the worst-case ``O(n^2)`` complexity of
``FFTPACK``
- the global interpreter lock (``GIL``) is released during transforms
- optional multithreading of multi-dimensional transforms via the ``workers``
argument

Note that `scipy.fftpack` has not been deprecated and will continue to be 
maintained but is now considered legacy. New code is recommended to use 
`scipy.fft` instead, where possible.

`scipy.fftpack` improvements
------------------------------
`scipy.fftpack` now uses pypocketfft to perform its FFTs, offering the same
speed and accuracy benefits listed for scipy.fft above but without the
improved API.

`scipy.integrate` improvements
------------------------------

The function `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` now has an ``args`` argument.
This allows the user-defined functions passed to the function to have
additional parameters without having to create wrapper functions or
lambda expressions for them.

`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` can now return a ``y_events`` attribute 
representing the solution of the ODE at event times

New ``OdeSolver`` is implemented --- ``DOP853``. This is a high-order explicit
Runge-Kutta method originally implemented in Fortran. Now we provide a pure 
Python implementation usable through ``solve_ivp`` with all its features.

`scipy.integrate.quad` provides better user feedback when break points are 
specified with a weighted integrand.

`scipy.integrate.quad_vec` is now available for general purpose integration
of vector-valued functions


`scipy.interpolate` improvements
--------------------------------
`scipy.interpolate.pade` now handles complex input data gracefully

`scipy.interpolate.Rbf` can now interpolate multi-dimensional functions

`scipy.io` improvements
-----------------------

`scipy.io.wavfile.read` can now read data from a `WAV` file that has a
malformed header, similar to other modern `WAV` file parsers

`scipy.io.FortranFile` now has an expanded set of available ``Exception``
classes for handling poorly-formatted files


`scipy.linalg` improvements
---------------------------
The function ``scipy.linalg.subspace_angles(A, B)`` now gives correct
results for complex-valued matrices. Before this, the function only returned
correct values for real-valued matrices.

New boolean keyword argument ``check_finite`` for `scipy.linalg.norm`; whether 
to check that the input matrix contains only finite numbers. Disabling may 
give a performance gain, but may result in problems (crashes, non-termination)
if the inputs do contain infinities or NaNs.

`scipy.linalg.solve_triangular` has improved performance for a C-ordered
triangular matrix

``LAPACK`` wrappers have been added for ``?geequ``, ``?geequb``, ``?syequb``,
and ``?heequb``

Some performance improvements may be observed due to an internal optimization
in operations involving LAPACK routines via ``_compute_lwork``. This is
particularly true for operations on small arrays.

Block ``QR`` wrappers are now available in `scipy.linalg.lapack`


`scipy.ndimage` improvements
----------------------------


`scipy.optimize` improvements
-----------------------------
It is now possible to use linear and non-linear constraints with 
`scipy.optimize.differential_evolution`.

`scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` has been re-written in C++ to improve 
performance, and now allows input costs to be infinite.

A ``ScalarFunction.fun_and_grad`` method was added for convenient simultaneous
retrieval of a function and gradient evaluation

`scipy.optimize.minimize` ``BFGS`` method has improved performance by avoiding
duplicate evaluations in some cases

Better user feedback is provided when an objective function returns an array
instead of a scalar.


`scipy.signal` improvements
---------------------------

Added a new function to calculate convolution using the overlap-add method,
named `scipy.signal.oaconvolve`. Like `scipy.signal.fftconvolve`, this
function supports specifying dimensions along which to do the convolution.

`scipy.signal.cwt` now supports complex wavelets.

The implementation of ``choose_conv_method`` has been updated to reflect the 
new FFT implementation. In addition, the performance has been significantly 
improved (with rather drastic improvements in edge cases).

The function ``upfirdn`` now has a ``mode`` keyword argument that can be used
to select the signal extension mode used at the signal boundaries. These modes
are also available for use in ``resample_poly`` via a newly added ``padtype``
argument.

`scipy.signal.sosfilt` now benefits from Cython code for improved performance

`scipy.signal.resample` should be more efficient by leveraging ``rfft`` when
possible

`scipy.sparse` improvements
---------------------------
It is now possible to use the LOBPCG method in `scipy.sparse.linalg.svds`.

`scipy.sparse.linalg.LinearOperator` now supports the operation ``rmatmat`` 
for adjoint matrix-matrix multiplication, in addition to ``rmatvec``.

Multiple stability updates enable float32 support in the LOBPCG eigenvalue 
solver for symmetric and Hermitian eigenvalues problems in 
``scipy.sparse.linalg.lobpcg``.

A solver for the maximum flow problem has been added as
`scipy.sparse.csgraph.maximum_flow`.

`scipy.sparse.csgraph.maximum_bipartite_matching` now allows non-square inputs,
no longer requires a perfect matching to exist, and has improved performance.

`scipy.sparse.lil_matrix` conversions now perform better in some scenarios

Basic support is available for ``pydata/sparse`` arrays in
`scipy.sparse.linalg`

`scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve_triangular` now supports the ``unit_diagonal``
argument to improve call signature similarity with its dense counterpart,
`scipy.linalg.solve_triangular`

``assertAlmostEqual`` may now be used with sparse matrices, which have added
support for ``__round__``

`scipy.spatial` improvements
----------------------------
The bundled Qhull library was upgraded to version 2019.1, fixing several
issues. Scipy-specific patches are no longer applied to it.

`scipy.spatial.SphericalVoronoi` now has linear memory complexity, improved
performance, and supports single-hemisphere generators. Support has also been
added for handling generators that lie on a great circle arc (geodesic input)
and for generators in n-dimensions.

`scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation` now includes functions for calculation of a
mean rotation, generation of the 3D rotation groups, and reduction of rotations
with rotational symmetries.

`scipy.spatial.transform.Slerp` is now callable with a scalar argument

`scipy.spatial.voronoi_plot_2d` now supports furthest site Voronoi diagrams

`scipy.spatial.Delaunay` and `scipy.spatial.Voronoi` now have attributes
for tracking whether they are furthest site diagrams

`scipy.special` improvements
----------------------------
The Voigt profile has been added as `scipy.special.voigt_profile`.

A real dispatch has been added for the Wright Omega function
(`scipy.special.wrightomega`).

The analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function has been added. (The 
Riemann zeta function is the one-argument variant of `scipy.special.zeta`.)

The complete elliptic integral of the first kind (`scipy.special.ellipk`) is 
now available in `scipy.special.cython_special`.

The accuracy of `scipy.special.hyp1f1` for real arguments has been improved.

The documentation of many functions has been improved.

`scipy.stats` improvements
--------------------------
`scipy.stats.multiscale_graphcorr` added as an independence test that
operates on high dimensional and nonlinear data sets. It has higher statistical
power than other `scipy.stats` tests while being the only one that operates on
multivariate data.

The generalized inverse Gaussian distribution (`scipy.stats.geninvgauss`) has 
been added.

It is now possible to efficiently reuse `scipy.stats.binned_statistic_dd` 
with new values by providing the result of a previous call to the function.

`scipy.stats.hmean` now handles input with zeros more gracefully.

The beta-binomial distribution is now available in `scipy.stats.betabinom`.

`scipy.stats.zscore`, `scipy.stats.circmean`, `scipy.stats.circstd`, and
`scipy.stats.circvar` now support the ``nan_policy`` argument for enhanced
handling of ``NaN`` values

`scipy.stats.entropy` now accepts an ``axis`` argument

`scipy.stats.gaussian_kde.resample` now accepts a ``seed`` argument to empower
reproducibility

`scipy.stats.kendalltau` performance has improved, especially for large inputs,
due to improved cache usage

`scipy.stats.truncnorm` distribution has been rewritten to support much wider
tails


Deprecated features
===================

`scipy` deprecations
--------------------
Support for NumPy functions exposed via the root SciPy namespace is deprecated
and will be removed in 2.0.0. For example, if you use ``scipy.rand`` or
``scipy.diag``, you should change your code to directly use
``numpy.random.default_rng`` or ``numpy.diag``, respectively.
They remain available in the currently continuing Scipy 1.x release series.

The exception to this rule is using ``scipy.fft`` as a function --
:mod:`scipy.fft` is now meant to be used only as a module, so the ability to
call ``scipy.fft(...)`` will be removed in SciPy 1.5.0.

In `scipy.spatial.Rotation` methods ``from_dcm``, ``as_dcm`` were renamed to 
``from_matrix``, ``as_matrix`` respectively. The old names will be removed in 
SciPy 1.6.0.

Method ``Rotation.match_vectors`` was deprecated in favor of 
``Rotation.align_vectors``, which provides a more logical and 
general API to the same functionality. The old method 
will be removed in SciPy 1.6.0.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

`scipy.special` changes
---------------------------
The deprecated functions ``hyp2f0``, ``hyp1f2``, and ``hyp3f0`` have been
removed.

The deprecated function ``bessel_diff_formula`` has been removed.

The function ``i0`` is no longer registered with ``numpy.dual``, so that 
``numpy.dual.i0`` will unconditionally refer to the NumPy version regardless 
of whether `scipy.special` is imported.

The function ``expn`` has been changed to return ``nan`` outside of its 
domain of definition (``x, n < 0``) instead of ``inf``.

`scipy.sparse` changes
---------------------------
Sparse matrix reshape now raises an error if shape is not two-dimensional, 
rather than guessing what was meant. The behavior is now the same as before 
SciPy 1.1.0.

``CSR`` and ``CSC`` sparse matrix classes should now return empty matrices
of the same type when indexed out of bounds. Previously, for some versions
of SciPy, this would raise an ``IndexError``. The change is largely motivated
by greater consistency with ``ndarray`` and ``numpy.matrix`` semantics.

`scipy.signal` changes
----------------------
`scipy.signal.resample` behavior for length-1 signal inputs has been
fixed to output a constant (DC) value rather than an impulse, consistent with
the assumption of signal periodicity in the FFT method.

`scipy.signal.cwt` now performs complex conjugation and time-reversal of
wavelet data, which is a backwards-incompatible bugfix for
time-asymmetric wavelets.

`scipy.stats` changes
---------------------
`scipy.stats.loguniform` added with better documentation as (an alias for
``scipy.stats.reciprocal``). ``loguniform`` generates random variables
that are equally likely in the log space; e.g., ``1``, ``10`` and ``100``
are all equally likely if ``loguniform(10 ** 0, 10 ** 2).rvs()`` is used.


Other changes
=============
The ``LSODA`` method of `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` now correctly detects stiff
problems.

`scipy.spatial.cKDTree` now accepts and correctly handles empty input data

`scipy.stats.binned_statistic_dd` now calculates the standard deviation 
statistic in a numerically stable way.

`scipy.stats.binned_statistic_dd` now throws an error if the input data 
contains either ``np.nan`` or ``np.inf``. Similarly, in `scipy.stats` now all 
continuous distributions' ``.fit()`` methods throw an error if the input data
contain any instance of either ``np.nan`` or ``np.inf``.
