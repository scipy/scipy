SciPy 1.15.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: SciPy 1.15.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 1.15.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and better
documentation. There have been a number of deprecations and API changes
in this release, which are documented below. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to this release, as there are a large number of bug-fixes and
optimizations. Before upgrading, we recommend that users check that
their own code does not use deprecated SciPy functionality (to do so,
run your code with ``python -Wd`` and check for ``DeprecationWarning`` s).
Our development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on the
1.15.x branch, and on adding new features on the main branch.

This release requires Python 3.10+ and NumPy 1.23.5 or greater.
