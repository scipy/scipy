Roadmap to Scipy 1.0
====================

This roadmap provides a high-level view on what is needed per scipy
sub-module in terms of new functionality, bug fixes, etc. before we can release
a ``1.0`` version of Scipy. Things not mentioned in this roadmap are
not necessarily unimportant or out of scope, however we (the Scipy developers)
want to provide to our users and contributors a clear picture of where Scipy is
going and where help is needed most urgently.

When a module is in a 1.0-ready state, it means that it has the functionality
we consider essential and has an API and code quality (including documentation
and tests) that's of high enough quality.  


cluster
-------
Not entirely clear whether or not to keep this module (not heavily used,
whether this is "basic" functionality is debatable; but is used by
scikit-learn).  If we do keep it, the following is needed:

  - vq_rewrite: drop or finish
  - Needs Cython rewrite for hierarchy_wrap

constants
---------
This module is basically done, low-maintenance and without open issues.


fftpack
-------
Needed:

  - solve issues with single precision: large errors, disabled for difficult sizes
  - fix caching bug
  - Bluestein algorithm nice to have, padding is alternative
  - deprecate fftpack.convolve as public function (was not meant to be public),
    resolve differences between ``signal.fftconvolve`` / ``fftpack.convolve`` /
    ``signal.convolve`` and ``numpy.convolve`` 

There's a large overlap with ``numpy.fft``.  This duplication has to change
(both are too widely used to deprecate one); in the documentation we should
make clear that ``scipy.fftpack`` is preferred over ``numpy.fft``.


integrate
---------
Needed for ODE solvers:

  - documentation is pretty bad, needs fixing
  - figure out if/how to integrate scikits.odes (Sundials wrapper)
  - figure out what to deprecate 

The numerical integration functions are in good shape, not much to do here.


interpolate
-----------
Needed:

  - Transparant B-splines and their usage in the interpolation routines is needed.
  - Both fitpack and fitpack2 interfaces will be kept.
  - splmake should go; is different spline representation --> need exactly one
  - interp1d/interp2d are somewhat ugly but widely used, so we keep them.
  - Regular grid interpolation routines needed


io
--
wavfile;

    - PCM float will be supported, for anything else use audiolab or other
      specialized libraries.
    - raise errors instead of warnings if data not understood.

netcdf:

    - TODO: check issue list

Other sub-modules (matlab, idl, harwell-boeing, arff, matrix market) are in
good shape.


lib
---
``scipy.lib`` contains nothing public anymore, so rename to ``scipy._lib``.


linalg
------
Needed:

  - remove functions that are duplicate with numpy.linalg
  - get_lapack_funcs should always use flapack
  - cblas, clapack are deprecated, will go away
  - wrap more lapack functions
  - one too many funcs for LU decomposition, remove one


misc
----
``scipy.misc`` will be removed as a public module.  The functions in it can be
moved to other modules:

  - pilutil, images : ndimage
  - comb, factorials, logsumexp, pade : special
  - derivative, central_diff_weight : remove
  - doccer : move to scipy._lib
  - info, who : these are in numpy


ndimage
-------
Keep, fix some critical bugs??  Ask Stefan


odr
---
Rename the module to ``regression`` or ``fitting``, include
``optimize.curve_fit``. This module will then provide a home for other fitting
functionality.


optimize
--------
Overall this module is in reasonably good shape, however it is missing:

  - large-scale optimizers
  - a few more good global optimizers

Other things that are needed:

  - deprecate ``anneal``, it just doesn't work well enough
  - clearly define what's out of scope for this module.


signal
------
- David C. will check in more detail
- splines --> check how much this is used; remove? Analog to Matlab funcs??
- Add proper wavelets, including discrete wavelet transform.  What's there now
  doesn't make much sense.
- Improve performance of ltisys (less internal transformations between
  different representations).


sparse
------
The sparse matrix formats are getting feature-complete but are slow ...
reimplement parts in Cython?

    - Small matrices are slower than PySparse, needs fixing

There are a lot of formats.  These should all be kept, but
improvements/optimizations should go into CSR/CSC, which are the preferred
formats.

Don't emulate np.matrix behavior, drop 2-D?


sparse.csgraph
--------------
This module is in good shape.


sparse.linalg
-------------
Arpack is in good shape.

isolve:

    - callback keyword is inconsistent 
    - tol keyword is broken, should be relative tol
    - Fortran code not re-entrant (but we don't solve, maybe re-use from
        PyKrilov)

dsolve:

    - remove umfpack wrapper due to license reasons
    - add sparse Cholesky or incomplete Cholesky
    - look at CHOLMOD


spatial
-------
KDTree/cKDTree and the QHull wrappers are in good shape.  The distance module
needs bug fixes in the distance metrics, and distance_wrap.c needs to be
cleaned up (maybe rewrite in Cython).


special
-------
special has a lot of functions that need improvements in precision.  All
functions that are also implemented in mpmath can be tested against mpmath, and
should match well.

Things not in mpmath:

  - cdflib
  - <Pauli checks> some others


stats
-----
This is a large module with by far the most open issues.  It has improved a lot
over the past few releases, but more cleanup and rewriting of functions is
needed.  The Statistics Review milestone on Github gives a reasonable overview
of which functions need checking, documentation and tests. 

``stats.distributions`` : 

  - skew/kurtosis of a number of distributions needs fixing
  - fix generic docstring examples, they should be valid Python and make sense
    for each distributions
  - document subclassing of distributions even better, make issues with state
    of instances clear.

The t-test functions need to be unified.
``gaussian_kde`` is in good shape but limited. It should not be expanded
probably, this fits better in statsmodels (which already has a lot more KDE
functionality).

``stats.mstats`` : unclear what to do with this.  It's a lot of work to fix it
up.  


weave
-----
This is the only module that was not ported to Python 3.  Effectively it's
deprecated (not recommended to use for new code).  In the future it should be
removed from scipy (can be made into a separate module). 


Other
-----
It should be made more clear what is public and what is private in scipy.
Everything private should be underscored as much as possible.

It's not clear how much functionality can be Cythonized without making the .so
files too large.  This needs measuring.
