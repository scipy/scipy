SciPy 0.12.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.12.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.12.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.12.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.4-2.7 or 3.1- and NumPy 1.X.X or greater.


New features
============

``scipy.sparse.linalg`` features
--------------------------------
- In ``scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve``, the ``b`` argument can now be either
  a vector or a matrix.
- ``scipy.sparse.linalg.inv`` was added.  This uses ``spsolve`` to compute
  a sparse matrix inverse.
- ``scipy.sparse.linalg.expm`` was added.  This computes the exponential of
  a sparse matrix using a similar algorithm to the existing dense array
  implementation in ``scipy.linalg.expm``.

cKDTRee improvements
--------------------
scipy.spatial: Cython version of KDTree, cKDTree, is now feature-complete.
Most operations (construction, query, query_ball_point, query_pairs,
count_neighbors and sparse_distance_matrix) are between 200 and 1000 times
faster in cKDTree than in KDTree.  With very minor caveats, cKDTree has
exactly the same interface as KDTree, and can be used as a drop-in replacement.


Deprecated features

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

Minor change in behavior of T-tests
