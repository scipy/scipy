SciPy 0.12.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.12.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.12.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.12.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.4-2.7 or 3.1- and NumPy 1.X.X or greater.


New features
============

``scipy.sparse.linalg`` features
--------------------------------
- In ``scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve``, the ``b`` argument can now be either
  a vector or a matrix.
- ``scipy.sparse.linalg.inv`` was added.  This uses ``spsolve`` to compute
  a sparse matrix inverse.
- ``scipy.sparse.linalg.expm`` was added.  This computes the exponential of
  a sparse matrix using a similar algorithm to the existing dense array
  implementation in ``scipy.linalg.expm``.

cKDTRee improvements
--------------------
scipy.spatial: Cython version of KDTree, cKDTree, is now feature-complete.
Most operations (construction, query, query_ball_point, query_pairs,
count_neighbors and sparse_distance_matrix) are between 200 and 1000 times
faster in cKDTree than in KDTree.  With very minor caveats, cKDTree has
exactly the same interface as KDTree, and can be used as a drop-in replacement.

Voronoi diagrams and convex hulls
---------------------------------
`scipy.spatial` now contains functionality for computing Voronoi
diagrams and convex hulls using the Qhull library. (Delaunay
triangulation was available since Scipy 0.9.0.)

Delaunay improvements
---------------------
It's now possible to pass in custom Qhull options in Delaunay
triangulation. Coplanar points are now also recorded, if present.
Incremental construction of Delaunay triangulations is now also
possible.

``scipy.optimize`` improvements
-------------------------------
A callback mechanism was added to L-BFGS-B and TNC minimization solvers.

Complex error functions in ``scipy.special``
--------------------------------------------
The computation of special functions related to the error function now uses a
new `Faddeeva library from MIT <http://ab-initio.mit.edu/Faddeeva>`__ which
increases their numerical precision. The scaled and imaginary error functions ``erfcx`` and
``erfi`` were also added, and the Dawson integral ``dawsn`` can now be
evaluated for a complex argument.

Listing Matlab(R) file contents
-------------------------------
A new function ``whosmat`` is available in ``scipy.io`` for inspecting contents
of MAT files without reading them to memory.

Faster orthogonal polynomials
-----------------------------
Evaluation of orthogonal polynomials (the ``eval_*`` routines) in now
faster in ``scipy.special``, and their ``out=`` argument functions
properly.

Documented BLAS and LAPACK low-level interfaces
-----------------------------------------------
The modules `scipy.linalg.blas` and `scipy.linalg.lapack` can be used
to access low-level BLAS and LAPACK functions.


Deprecated features
===================

`scipy.lib.lapack`
------------------
The module `scipy.lib.lapack` is deprecated. You can use
`scipy.linalg.lapack` instead. The module `scipy.lib.blas` was
deprecated earlier in Scipy 0.10.0.

`fblas` and `cblas`
-------------------
Accessing the modules `scipy.linalg.fblas`, `cblas`, `flapack`,
`clapack` is deprecated. Instead, use the modules
`scipy.linalg.lapack` and `scipy.linalg.blas`.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

Minor change in behavior of T-tests
-----------------------------------
