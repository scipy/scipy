SciPy 0.12.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.12.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.12.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.12.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.4-2.7 or 3.1- and NumPy 1.X.X or greater.


New features
============

* scipy.spatial: Cython version of KDTree, cKDTree, is now feature-complete.
  Most operations (construction, query, query_ball_point, query_pairs,
  count_neighbors and sparse_distance_matrix) are between 200 and 1000 times
  faster in cKDTree than in KDTree.  With very minor caveats, cKDTree has
  exactly the same interface as KDTree, and can be used as a drop-in
  replacement.
