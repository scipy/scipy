SciPy 0.14.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.14.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.14.0 is the culmination of 8 months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.14.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.4 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.


New features
============

``scipy.interpolate`` improvements
----------------------------------

Faster implementations of piecewise polynomials in power and Bernstein
polynomial bases have been added as `scipy.interpolate.PPoly` and
`scipy.interpolate.BPoly`. New users should use these in favor of
`scipy.interpolate.PiecewisePolynomial`.

`scipy.interpolate.interp1d` now accepts non-monotonic inputs and sorts them.
If performance is critical, sorting can be turned off by using the new
``assume_sorted`` keyword.

Functionality for evaluation of bivariate spline derivatives in
``scipy.interpolate`` has been added.


``scipy.linalg`` improvements
-----------------------------

The new function `scipy.linalg.dft` computes the matrix of the
discrete Fourier transform.

A condition number estimation function for matrix exponential,
`scipy.linalg.expm_cond`, has been added.


``scipy.optimize`` improvements
-------------------------------

A set of benchmarks for optimize, which can be run with ``optimize.bench()``,
has been added.

`scipy.optimize.curve_fit` now has more controllable error estimation via the
``absolute_sigma`` keyword.


``scipy.stats`` improvements
----------------------------

A new class `scipy.stats.multivariate_normal` with functionality for 
multivariate normal random variables has been added.

A lot of work on the ``scipy.stats`` distribution framework has been done.
Moment calculations (skew and kurtosis mainly) are fixed and verified, all
examples are now runnable, and many small accuracy and performance improvements
for individual distributions were merged.


``scipy.signal`` improvements
-----------------------------

``scipy.signal.iirfilter`` and related functions to design Butterworth,
Chebyshev, elliptical and Bessel IIR filters now all use pole-zero ("zpk")
format internally instead of using transformations to numerator/denominator
format.  The accuracy of the produced filters, especially high-order ones, is
improved significantly as a result.

The new function `scipy.signal.vectorstrength` computes the vector strength,
a measure of phase synchrony, of a set of events.


``scipy.special`` improvements
------------------------------

The functions `scipy.special.boxcox` and `scipy.special.boxcox1p`, which
compute the Box-Cox transformation, have been added.


``scipy.sparse`` improvements
-----------------------------

- Significant performance improvement in CSR, CSC, and DOK indexing speed. 
- When using Numpy >= 1.9 (to be released in MM 2014), sparse matrices function
  correctly when given to arguments of ``np.dot``, ``np.multiply`` and other
  ufuncs.  With earlier Numpy and Scipy versions, the results of such
  operations are undefined and usually unexpected. 
- Sparse matrices are no longer limited to ``2^31`` nonzero elements.  They
  automatically switch to using 64-bit index data type for matrices containing
  more elements.  User code written assuming the sparse matrices use int32 as
  the index data type will continue to work, except for such large matrices.
  Code dealing with larger matrices needs to accept either int32 or int64
  indices. 


Deprecated features
===================

``anneal``
----------

The global minimization function `scipy.optimize.anneal` is deprecated.
All users should use the `scipy.optimize.basinhopping` function instead.

``scipy.stats``
---------------

``randwcdf`` and ``randwppf`` functions are deprecated. All users should use
distribution-specific ``rvs`` methods instead.

Probability calculation aliases ``zprob``, ``fprob`` and ``ksprob`` are
deprecated. Use instead the ``sf`` methods of the corresponding distributions
or the ``special`` functions directly.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

scipy.special.lpmn
------------------

``lpmn`` no longer accepts complex-valued arguments. A new function
``clpmn`` with uniform complex analytic behavior has been added, and
it should be used instead.

scipy.sparse.linalg
-------------------

Eigenvectors in the case of generalized eigenvalue problem are normalized to
unit vectors in 2-norm, rather than following the LAPACK normalization
convention.

scipy.stats
-----------

The deprecated functions ``glm``, ``oneway`` and ``cmedian`` have been removed
from ``scipy.stats``.

``stats.scoreatpercentile`` now returns an array instead of a list of
percentiles.
