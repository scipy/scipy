==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.14.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.14.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.14.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.3 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.


New features
============

``scipy.linalg`` improvements
-----------------------------

Discrete Fourier transform matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The new function `scipy.linalg.dft` computes the matrix of the
discrete Fourier transform.

``scipy.stats`` improvements
----------------------------

Multivariate random variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new class `scipy.stats.multivariate_normal` with functionality for 
multivariate normal random variables has been added.


Deprecated features
===================


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

scipy.special.lpmn
------------------

``lpmn`` no longer accepts complex-valued arguments. A new function
``clpmn`` with uniform complex analytic behavior has been added, and
it should be used instead.
