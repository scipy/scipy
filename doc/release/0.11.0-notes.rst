SciPy 0.11.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.11.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.11.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.11.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.4-2.7 or 3.1- and NumPy 1.X.X or greater.


New features
============

``scipy.optimize`` improvements
-------------------------------

The optimize module has received a lot of attention this release.  In addition
to added tests, documentation improvements, bug fixes and code clean-up, the
following improvements were made:

- A unified interface to minimizers of multivariate functions has been added.
- The L-BFGS-B algorithm has been updated to version 3.0.


Unified interface to minimizers of multivariate functions
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

A new function ``scipy.optimize.minimize`` was added to provide a common
interface to minimizers of multivariate functions (unconstrained: `fmin`,
`fmin_powell`, `fmin_cg`, `fmin_ncg`, `fmin_bfgs` and `anneal` or
constrained: `fmin_l_bfgs_b`, `fmin_tnc`, `fmin_cobyla` and `fmin_slsqp`).
This allows for easier comparing and switching between solvers.


New matrix equation solvers (``scipy.linalg``)
----------------------------------------------

Solvers for the Sylvester equation (``scipy.linalg.solve_sylvester``, discrete
and continuous Lyapunov equations (``scipy.linalg.solve_lyapunov``,
``scipy.linalg.solve_discrete_lyapunov``) and discrete and continuous algebraic
Riccati equations (``scipy.linalg.solve_continuous_are``,
``scipy.linalg.solve_discrete_are``) have been added to ``scipy.linalg``.
These solvers are often used in the field of linear control theory.


Constructing sparse matrices
----------------------------

Two new functions, ``scipy.sparse.diags`` and ``scipy.sparse.block_diag``, were
added to easily construct diagonal and block-diagonal sparse matrices
respectively.


LSMR iterative solver
---------------------

LSMR, an iterative method for solving (sparse) linear and linear
least-squares systems, was added as ``scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr``.


Discrete Sine Transform
-----------------------

Bindings for the discrete sine transform functions have been added to
``scipy.fftpack``.


Pascal matrix function
----------------------

A function for creating Pascal matrices, ``scipy.linalg.pascal``, was added.


``scipy.misc.logsumexp``
------------------------

``misc.logsumexp`` now takes an optional ``axis`` keyword argument.


Deprecated features
===================

``scipy.misc.radon`` has been deprecated.  A more full-featured radon transform
can be found in scikits-image.

``scipy.io.save_as_module`` has been deprecated.  A better way to save multiple
Numpy arrays is the ``numpy.savez`` function.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

Removal of ``scipy.maxentropy``
-------------------------------

The ``scipy.maxentropy`` module, which was deprecated in the 0.10.0 release,
has been removed.  Logistic regression in scikits.learn is a good and modern
alternative for this functionality.  
 

Other changes
=============

The SuperLU sources in ``scipy.sparse.linalg`` have been updated to version 4.3
from upstream.

The function ``scipy.linalg.qr_multiply``, which allows efficient computation
of the matrix product of Q (from a QR decompostion) and a vector, has been
added.
