SciPy 0.16.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.16.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.16.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.15.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.3 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.


New features
============

Benchmark suite
---------------

The benchmark suite has switched to using `Airspeed Velocity
<http://spacetelescope.github.io/asv/>`__ for benchmarking. You can
run the suite locally via ``python runtests.py --bench``. For more
details, see ``benchmarks/README.rst``.


`scipy.linalg` improvements
---------------------------

The function `scipy.linalg.invpascal` computes the inverse of a Pascal matrix.

Added wrapper for potentially useful LAPACK function `*lasd4`. It computes the
square root of the i-th updated eigenvalue of a positive symmetric rank-one
modification to a positive diagonal matrix. See its LAPACK documentation and
unit tests for it to get more info.

`scipy.signal` improvements
---------------------------

Support for second order sections (SOS) as a format for IIR filters
was added.  The new functions are:

* `scipy.signal.sosfilt`
* `scipy.signal.sosfilt_zi`,
* `scipy.signal.sos2tf`
* `scipy.signal.sos2zpk`
* `scipy.signal.tf2sos`
* `scipy.signal.zpk2sos`.

Additionally, the filter design functions `iirdesign`, `iirfilter`, `butter`,
`cheby1`, `cheby2`, `ellip`, and `bessel` can return the filter in the SOS
format.

The function `scipy.signal.place_poles`, which provides two methods to place
poles for linear systems, was added.

The option to use Gustafsson's method for choosing the initial conditions
of the forward and backward passes was added to `scipy.signal.filtfilt`.

An exponential (Poisson) window was added as `scipy.signal.exponential`.

The function for computing digital filter group delay was added as
`scipy.signal.group_delay`.

`scipy.spatial` improvements
----------------------------

The function `scipy.spatial.procrustes` for Procrustes analysis (statistical
shape analysis) was added.

`scipy.stats` improvements
--------------------------

The Wishart distribution and its inverse have been added, as
`scipy.stats.wishart` and `scipy.stats.invwishart`.

The Exponentially Modified Normal distribution has been
added as `scipy.stats.exponnorm`.

`scipy.optimize` improvements
-----------------------------

A new derivative-free method DF-SANE has been added to the nonlinear equation
system solving function `scipy.optimize.root`.


Deprecated features
===================

``scipy.stats.pdf_fromgamma`` is deprecated.  This function was undocumented,
untested and rarely used.  Statsmodels provides equivalent functionality
with ``statsmodels.distributions.ExpandedNormal``.

``scipy.stats.fastsort`` is deprecated.  This function is unnecessary,
``numpy.argsort`` can be used instead.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

The deprecated global optimizer ``scipy.optimize.anneal`` was removed.

The following deprecated modules have been removed: ``scipy.lib.blas``,
``scipy.lib.lapack``, ``scipy.linalg.cblas``, ``scipy.linalg.fblas``,
``scipy.linalg.clapack``, ``scipy.linalg.flapack``.  They had been deprecated
since Scipy 0.12.0, the functionality should be accessed as `scipy.linalg.blas`
and `scipy.linalg.lapack`.

The deprecated function ``scipy.special.all_mat`` has been removed.

The deprecated functions ``fprob``, ``ksprob``, ``zprob``, ``randwcdf``
and ``randwppf`` have been removed from `scipy.stats`.
