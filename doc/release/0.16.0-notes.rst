SciPy 0.16.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.16.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.16.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.15.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.3 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.


New features
============

`scipy.linalg` improvements
---------------------------

The function `scipy.linalg.invpascal` computes the inverse of a Pascal matrix.

`scipy.signal` improvements
---------------------------

The option to use Gustafsson's method for choosing the initial conditions
of the forward and backward passes was added to `scipy.signal.filtfilt`.

`scipy.stats` improvements
--------------------------

The Wishart distribution and its inverse have been added, as
`scipy.stats.wishart` and `scipy.stats.invwishart`.


Deprecated features
===================

``scipy.stats.pdf_fromgamma`` is deprecated.  This function was undocumented,
untested and rarely used.  Statsmodels provides equivalent functionality
with ``statsmodels.distributions.ExpandedNormal``.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

The deprecated global optimizer ``scipy.optimize.anneal`` was removed.
