SciPy 0.16.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.16.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.16.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.15.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.3 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.


New features
============

`scipy.linalg` improvements
---------------------------

The function `scipy.linalg.invpascal` computes the inverse of a Pascal matrix.

`scipy.signal` improvements
---------------------------

Support for second order sections (SOS) as a format for IIR filters
was added.  The new functions are:

* `scipy.signal.sosfilt`
* `scipy.signal.sosfilt_zi`,
* `scipy.signal.sos2tf`
* `scipy.signal.sos2zpk`
* `scipy.signal.tf2sos`
* `scipy.signal.zpk2sos`.

Additionally, the filter design functions `iirdesign`, `iirfilter`, `butter`,
`cheby1`, `cheby2`, `ellip`, and `bessel` can return the filter in the SOS
format.

The option to use Gustafsson's method for choosing the initial conditions
of the forward and backward passes was added to `scipy.signal.filtfilt`.

`scipy.stats` improvements
--------------------------

The Wishart distribution and its inverse have been added, as
`scipy.stats.wishart` and `scipy.stats.invwishart`.

`scipy.optimize` improvements
-----------------------------

A new derivative-free method DF-SANE has been added to the nonlinear equation
system solving function `scipy.optimize.root`.


Deprecated features
===================

``scipy.stats.pdf_fromgamma`` is deprecated.  This function was undocumented,
untested and rarely used.  Statsmodels provides equivalent functionality
with ``statsmodels.distributions.ExpandedNormal``.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

The deprecated global optimizer ``scipy.optimize.anneal`` was removed.

The following deprecated modules have been removed: ``scipy.lib.blas``,
``scipy.lib.lapack``, ``scipy.linalg.cblas``, ``scipy.linalg.fblas``,
``scipy.linalg.clapack``, ``scipy.linalg.flapack``.  They had been deprecated
since Scipy 0.12.0, the functionality should be accessed as `scipy.linalg.blas`
and `scipy.linalg.lapack`.

The deprecated function ``scipy.special.all_mat`` has been removed.
