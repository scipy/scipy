SciPy 1.10.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 1.10.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 1.10.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and better
documentation. There have been a number of deprecations and API changes
in this release, which are documented below. All users are encouraged to
upgrade to this release, as there are a large number of bug-fixes and
optimizations. Before upgrading, we recommend that users check that
their own code does not use deprecated SciPy functionality (to do so,
run your code with ``python -Wd`` and check for ``DeprecationWarning`` s).
Our development attention will now shift to bug-fix releases on the
1.10.x branch, and on adding new features on the main branch.

This release requires Python 3.8+ and NumPy 1.18.5 or greater.

For running on PyPy, PyPy3 6.0+ is required.
