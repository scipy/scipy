SciPy 0.9.0 Release Notes
=========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.9.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.9.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.9.x branch, and on adding
new features on the development trunk.

This release requires Python 2.4 - 2.7 or 3.1 - and NumPy 1.5 or greater.

Please note that SciPy is still considered to have "Beta" status, as
we work toward a SciPy 1.0.0 release.  The 1.0.0 release will mark a
major milestone in the development of SciPy, after which changing the
package structure or API will be much more difficult.  Whilst these
pre-1.0 releases are considered to have "Beta" status, we are
committed to making them as bug-free as possible.  For example, in
addition to fixing numerous bugs in this release, we have also doubled
the number of unit tests since the last release.

However, until the 1.0 release, we are aggressively reviewing and
refining the functionality, organization, and interface. This is being
done in an effort to make the package as coherent, intuitive, and
useful as possible.  To achieve this, we need help from the community
of users.  Specifically, we need feedback regarding all aspects of the
project - everything - from which algorithms we implement, to details
about our function's call signatures.

Python 3
========

Scipy 0.9.0 has full support for Python 3.

Deprecated features
===================

Obsolete nonlinear solvers (in ``scipy.optimize``)
--------------------------------------------------

The following nonlinear solvers from ``scipy.optimize`` are
deprecated:

- ``broyden_modified`` (bad performance)
- ``broyden1_modified`` (bad performance)
- ``broyden_generalized`` (equivalent to ``anderson``)
- ``anderson2`` (equivalent to ``anderson``)
- ``broyden3`` (obsoleted by new limited-memory broyden methods)
- ``vackar`` (renamed to ``diagbroyden``)


New features
============

Delaunay tesselations (``scipy.spatial``)
-----------------------------------------

Scipy now includes routines for computing Delaunay tesselations in N
dimensions, powered by the Qhull_ computational geometry library. Such
calculations can now make use of the new ``scipy.spatial.Delaunay``
interface.

N-dimensional interpolation (``scipy.interpolate``)
---------------------------------------------------

Support for scattered data interpolation is now significantly
improved.  This version includes a ``scipy.interpolate.griddata``
function that can perform linear and nearest-neighbour interpolation
for N-dimensional scattered data, in addition to cubic spline
(C1-smooth) interpolation in 2D and 1D.  An object-oriented interface
to each interpolator type is also available.

Nonlinear equation solvers (``scipy.optimize``)
-----------------------------------------------

Scipy includes new routines for large-scale nonlinear equation solving
in ``scipy.optimize``.  The following methods are implemented:

* Newton-Krylov (``scipy.optimize.newton_krylov``)

* (Generalized) secant methods:

  - Limited-memory Broyden methods (``scipy.optimize.broyden1``,
    ``scipy.optimize.broyden2``)

  - Anderson method (``scipy.optimize.anderson``)

* Simple iterations (``scipy.optimize.diagbroyden``,
  ``scipy.optimize.excitingmixing``, ``scipy.optimize.linearmixing``)

The ``scipy.optimize.nonlin`` module was completely rewritten, and
some of the functions were deprecated (see above).


New linear algebra routines (``scipy.linalg``)
----------------------------------------------

Scipy now contains routines for effectively solving triangular
equation systems (``scipy.linalg.solve_triangular``).


Improved FIR filter design functions (``scipy.signal``)
-------------------------------------------------------

The function ``scipy.signal.firwin`` was enhanced to allow the
design of highpass, bandpass, bandstop and multi-band FIR filters.

The functions ``scipy.signal.kaiser_atten`` and ``scipy.signal.kaiser_beta``
were added. 


Removed features
================

The deprecated modules ``helpdmod``, ``pexec`` and ``ppimport`` were removed
from ``scipy.misc``.
