SciPy 0.17.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.17.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.17.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.16.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.4 and NumPy 1.6.2 or greater.


New features
============

Linear assignment problem solver
-------------------------------

``scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment`` is a new function for solving the
linear sum assignment problem. It uses the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn-Munkres).

``scipy.optimize.fmin_bfgs_h`` is a gradient based function for minimization 
independent of the target function itself. It uses the BFGS(Hess) algorithm.

Deprecated features
===================

``scipy.stats.threshold`` and ``scipy.mstats.threshold`` are being deprecated
in favor of ``np.clip``. See issue #617 for details.

``scipy.stats.ss`` is deprecated. This is a support function, not meant to 
be exposed to the user. Also, the name is unclear. See issue #663 for details.

``scipy.stats.square_of_sums`` is deprecated. This too is a support function 
not meant to be exposed to the user. See issues #665 and #663 for details.

``scipy.stats.f_value``, ``scipy.stats.f_value_multivariate``,
``scipy.stats.f_value_wilks_lambda``, and ``scipy.mstats.f_value_wilks_lambda`` 
are deprecated. These are related to ANOVA, for which ``scipy.stats`` provides 
quite limited functionality and these functions are not very useful standalone.
See issues #660 and #650 for details.

``scipy.stats.chisqprob`` is deprecated. This is an alias. ``stats.chi2.sf`` 
should be used instead. 

``scipy.stats.betai`` is deprecated. This is an alias for ``special.betainc`` 
which should be used instead.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

The functions ``stats.trim1`` and ``stats.trimboth`` now make sure the 
elements trimmed are the lowest and/or highest, depending on the case.
Slicing without at least partial sorting was previously done, but didn't
make sense for unsorted input.

When ``variable_names`` is set to an empty list, ``scipy.io.loadmat`` now
correctly returns no values instead of all the contents of the MAT file.

Element-wise multiplication of sparse matrices now returns a sparse result
in all cases. Previously, multiplying a sparse matrix with a dense matrix or
array would return a dense matrix.

The function ``misc.lena`` has been removed due to license incompatibility.

Other changes
=============

``scipy.constants`` is updated to the CODATA 2014 recommended values.
