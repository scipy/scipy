SciPy 0.13.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.13.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.13.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.13.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.1-3.3 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.


New features
============

``scipy.optimize`` improvements
-------------------------------

Trust-region unconstrained minimization algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``minimize`` function gained two trust-region solvers for unconstrained
minimization: ``dogleg`` and ``trust-ncg``. These provide an alternative to
traditional line search algorithms already present in ``scipy.optimize``.


Deprecated features
===================


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

LIL matrix assignment
---------------------
Assigning values to LIL matrices with two index arrays now works similarly as
assigning into ndarrays::

    >>> x = lil_matrix((3, 3))
    >>> x[[0,1,2],[0,1,2]]=[0,1,2]
    >>> x.todense()
    matrix([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  1.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  0.,  2.]])

rather than giving the result::

    >>> x.todense()
    matrix([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
            [ 0.,  1.,  2.],
            [ 0.,  1.,  2.]])

Users relying on the previous behavior will need to revisit their code.


Deprecated ``radon`` function removed
-------------------------------------

The ``misc.radon`` function, which was deprecated in scipy 0.11.0, has been
removed.  Users can find a more full-featured ``radon`` function in
scikit-image.

Removed deprecated keywords ``xa`` and ``xb`` from ``stats.distributions``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The keywords ``xa`` and ``xb``, which were deprecated since 0.11.0, have
been removed from the distributions in ``scipy.stats``.
