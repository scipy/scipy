SciPy 0.13.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.13.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.13.0 is the culmination of 5 months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.13.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.1-3.3 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.


New features
============

``scipy.optimize`` improvements
-------------------------------

Trust-region unconstrained minimization algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ``minimize`` function gained two trust-region solvers for unconstrained
minimization: ``dogleg`` and ``trust-ncg``. These provide an alternative to
traditional line search algorithms already present in ``scipy.optimize``.


``scipy.linalg`` improvements
-----------------------------

Interpolative decompositions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scipy now includes a new module `scipy.linalg.interpolative`
containing routines for computing interpolative matrix decompositions
(ID). This feature is based on the ID software package by
P.G. Martinsson, V. Rokhlin, Y. Shkolnisky, and M. Tygert, previously
adapted for Python in the PymatrixId package by K.L. Ho.

Polar decomposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new function `scipy.linalg.polar`, to compute the polar decomposition 
of a matrix, was added.


BLAS level 3 functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The BLAS functions ``symm``, ``syrk``, ``syr2k``, ``hemm``, ``herk`` and
``her2k`` are now wrapped in `scipy.linalg`.


Matrix functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several matrix function algorithms have been implemented or updated
following detailed descriptions in recent papers of Nick Higham
and his co-authors.
These include
the matrix square root (``sqrtm``),
the matrix logarithm (``logm``),
the matrix exponential (``expm``)
and its Frechet derivative (``expm_frechet``),
and fractional matrix powers (``fractional_matrix_power``).


``scipy.sparse`` improvements
-----------------------------

Boolean comparisons and sparse matrices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All sparse matrix types now support boolean data, and boolean operations.
So if we have two sparse matrices `A` and `B`, they can be compared in all the
expected ways: `A < B`, `A >= B`, `A != B`, etc. And return sparse matrices.
Comparisons with dense matrices and scalars are also supported. 

CSR and CSC fancy indexing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Compressed sparse row and column sparse matrix types now support fancy indexing
with boolean matrices, slices, and lists. So where A is a (CSC or CSR) sparse
matrix, you can do things like::

    >>> A[A > 0.5] = 1  # Since Boolean sparse matrices work!

    >>> A[:2, :3] = 2

    >>> A[[1,2], 2] = 3


``scipy.sparse.linalg`` improvements
------------------------------------

The new function ``onenormest``
provides a lower bound of the 1-norm of a linear operator
and has been implemented according to Higham and Tisseur (2000).
This function is not only useful for sparse matrices,
but can also be used to estimate the norm of
products or powers of dense matrices without explictly building the
intermediate matrix.

The multiplicative action of the matrix exponential of a linear operator
(``expm_multiply``) has been implemented following the description
in Al-Mohy and Higham (2011).


``scipy.special`` improvements
------------------------------

New function `scipy.special.xlogy` and `scipy.special.xlog1py` were added.
These functions can simplify and speed up code that has to calculate 
``x * log(y)`` and give 0 when ``x == 0``.


N-dimensional numerical integration
-----------------------------------

A new function `scipy.integrate.nquad`, which provides N-dimensional
integration functionality with a more flexible interface than ``dblquad`` and
``tplquad``, has been added.


Unformatted Fortran file reader
-------------------------------

A new class `scipy.io.FortranFile` which facilitates reading unformatted
sequential files written by Fortran code.

B-spline derivatives and antiderivatives
----------------------------------------

`scipy.interpolate.splder` and `scipy.interpolate.splantider` functions 
for computing B-splines that represent derivatives and antiderivatives
of B-splines were added.  These functions are also available in the 
class-based FITPACK interface as ``UnivariateSpline.derivative`` and
``UnivariateSpline.antiderivative``.


``scipy.stats`` improvements
----------------------------

Distributions now allow using keyword parameters in addition to
positional parameters in all methods.


Deprecated features
===================


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

LIL matrix assignment
---------------------
Assigning values to LIL matrices with two index arrays now works similarly as
assigning into ndarrays::

    >>> x = lil_matrix((3, 3))
    >>> x[[0,1,2],[0,1,2]]=[0,1,2]
    >>> x.todense()
    matrix([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  1.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  0.,  2.]])

rather than giving the result::

    >>> x.todense()
    matrix([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
            [ 0.,  1.,  2.],
            [ 0.,  1.,  2.]])

Users relying on the previous behavior will need to revisit their code.


Deprecated ``radon`` function removed
-------------------------------------

The ``misc.radon`` function, which was deprecated in scipy 0.11.0, has been
removed.  Users can find a more full-featured ``radon`` function in
scikit-image.

Removed deprecated keywords ``xa`` and ``xb`` from ``stats.distributions``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The keywords ``xa`` and ``xb``, which were deprecated since 0.11.0, have
been removed from the distributions in ``scipy.stats``.


Other changes
=============

Cython is now required to build *unreleased* versions of scipy.
The C files generated from Cython sources are not included in the git repo
anymore.  They are however still shipped in source releases.

The code base received a fairly large PEP8 cleanup.  A ``tox pep8`` 
command has been added; new code should pass this test command.
