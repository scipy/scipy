SciPy 0.13.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.13.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.13.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.13.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.1-3.3 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.

Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

LIL matrix assignment
---------------------
Assigning values to LIL matrices with two index arrays now works similarly as
assigning into ndarrays::

    >>> x = lil_matrix((3, 3))
    >>> x[[0,1,2],[0,1,2]]=[0,1,2]
    >>> x.todense()
    matrix([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  1.,  0.],
            [ 0.,  0.,  2.]])

rather than giving the result::

    >>> x.todense()
    matrix([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
            [ 0.,  1.,  2.],
            [ 0.,  1.,  2.]])

Users relying on the previous behavior will need to revisit their code.
