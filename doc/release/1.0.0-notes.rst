SciPy 1.0.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 1.0.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 1.0.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 1.0.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.7 or 3.4+ and NumPy 1.8.2 or greater.


New features
============

`scipy.cluster` improvements
----------------------------

`scipy.cluster.optimal_leaf_ordering`, a function to reorder a linkage matrix
to minimize distances between adjacent leaves, was added.


`scipy.integrate` improvements
------------------------------

A set of new ODE solvers have been added to `scipy.integrate`.  The convenience
function `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` allows uniform access to all solvers.
The individual solvers (``RK23``, ``RK45``, ``Radau``, ``BDF`` and ``LSODA``)
can also be used directly.


`scipy.linalg` improvements
----------------------------

Wrappers for the LAPACK functions ``*gels``, ``sstev`` and ``dstev`` have been
added.


`scipy.ndimage` improvements
----------------------------

Support for homogeneous coordinate transforms has been added to
`scipy.ndimage.affine_transform`.

The ``ndimage`` C code underwent a significant refactoring


`scipy.sparse` improvements
---------------------------

Iterating over and slicing of CSC and CSR matrices is now faster by up to ~35%.

The ``tocsr`` method of COO matrices is now several times faster.

The ``diagonal`` method of sparse matrices now takes a parameter, indicating
which diagonal to return.


`scipy.sparse.linalg` improvements
----------------------------------

`scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr` now accepts an initial guess, yielding potentially
faster convergence.

The function `scipy.linalg.subspace_angles` has been added to compute the
subspace angles between two matrices.

SuperLU was updated to version 5.2.1.


`scipy.optimize` improvements
-----------------------------

The method `trust-exact` was added to the function `scipy.optimize.minimize`.
This new trust-region method solves the subproblem with higher accuracy at the cost
of more Hessian factorizations (compared to dogleg) and is able to deal with indefinite
Hessians. It seems very competitive against the other Newton methods implemented in scipy.

`scipy.optimize.linprog` gained an interior point method.  Its performance is
superior (both in accuracy and speed) to the older simplex method.


`scipy.stats` improvements
--------------------------

The methods `logcdf` and `cdf` were added to `scipy.stats.multivariate_normal`,
providing the cumulative distribution function of the multivariate normal
distribution.  The underlying code is the classic one by Alan Genz (see
`scipy/stats/mvndst.f`).


Deprecated features
===================

``scipy.interpolate.interpolate_wrapper`` and all functions in that submodule
are deprecated.  This was a never finished set of wrapper functions which is
not relevant anymore.

The ``fillvalue`` of ``scipy.signal.convolve2d`` will be cast directly to the
dtypes of the input arrays in the future and checked that it is a scalar or
an array with a single element.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

The default value for the ``zero_phase`` keyword of `scipy.signal.decimate`
has been changed to True.

The `kmeans` and `kmeans` functions in `scipy.cluster.vq` changed the method
used for random initialization, so using a fixed random seed will
not necessarily produce the same results as in previous versions.

`scipy.special.gammaln` does not accept complex arguments anymore.

The deprecated functions `sph_jn`, `sph_yn`, `sph_jnyn`, `sph_in`,
`sph_kn`, and `sph_inkn` have been removed. Users should instead use
the functions `spherical_jn`, `spherical_yn`, `spherical_in`, and
`spherical_kn`. Be aware that the new functions have different
signatures.

The cross-class properties of `scipy.signal.lti` systems have been removed.
The following properties/setters have been removed:

Name - (accessing/setting has been removed) - (setting has been removed)

* StateSpace - (``num``, ``den``, ``gain``) - (``zeros``, ``poles``)
* TransferFunction (``A``, ``B``, ``C``, ``D``, ``gain``) - (``zeros``, ``poles``)
* ZerosPolesGain (``A``, ``B``, ``C``, ``D``, ``num``, ``den``) - ()


The method ``var`` for the Dirichlet distribution of `scipy.stats.multivariate`
now returns a scalar rather than an ndarray when the length of alpha is 1.


Other changes
=============

SciPy now has a formal governance structure.  It consists of a BDFL (Pauli
Virtanen) and a Steering Committee.  See `the governance document
<https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/doc/source/dev/governance/governance.rst>`_
for details.

It is now possible to build SciPy on Windows with MSVC + gfortran!  Continuous
integration has been set up for this build configuration on Appveyor, building
against OpenBLAS.

The SciPy test suite has been migrated from ``nose`` to ``pytest``.

Continuous integration for OS X has been set up on TravisCI.

``scipy/_distributor_init.py`` was added to allow redistributors of SciPy to
add custom code that needs to run when importing SciPy (e.g. checks for
hardware, DLL search paths, etc.).

Support for PEP 518 (specifying build system requirements) was added - see
``pyproject.toml`` in the root of the SciPy repository.

In order to have consistent function names, the function
`scipy.linalg.solve_lyapunov` is renamed to `scipy.linalg.solve_continuous_lyapunov`.
The old name is kept for backwards-compatibility.
