SciPy 0.10.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.10.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.10.0 is the culmination of XXX months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.10.x branch, and on adding
new features on the development trunk.

This release requires Python 2.4 - 2.7 or 3.1 - and NumPy 1.5 or greater.

Please note that SciPy is still considered to have "Beta" status, as
we work toward a SciPy 1.0.0 release.  The 1.0.0 release will mark a
major milestone in the development of SciPy, after which changing the
package structure or API will be much more difficult.  Whilst these
pre-1.0 releases are considered to have "Beta" status, we are
committed to making them as bug-free as possible.  For example, in
addition to fixing numerous bugs in this release, we have also doubled
the number of unit tests since the last release.

However, until the 1.0 release, we are aggressively reviewing and
refining the functionality, organization, and interface. This is being
done in an effort to make the package as coherent, intuitive, and
useful as possible.  To achieve this, we need help from the community
of users.  Specifically, we need feedback regarding all aspects of the
project - everything - from which algorithms we implement, to details
about our function's call signatures.


New features
============

Generalized and shift-invert eigenvalue problems in ``scipy.sparse.linalg``
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sparse eigenvalue problem solver functions
``scipy.sparse.eigs/eigh`` now support generalized eigenvalue
problems, and all shift-invert modes available in ARPACK.


Discrete-Time Linear Systems (``scipy.signal``)
-----------------------------------------------

Support for simulating discrete-time linear systems, including
``scipy.signal.dlsim``, ``scipy.signal.dimpulse``, and ``scipy.signal.dstep``,
has been added to SciPy.  Conversion of linear systems from continuous-time to
discrete-time representations is also present via the
``scipy.signal.cont2discrete`` function.


Enhanced filtfilt function in ``scipy.signal``
----------------------------------------------

The forward-backward filter function `scipy.signal.filtfilt` can now
filter the data in a given axis of an n-dimensional numpy array.
(Previously it only handled a 1-dimensional array.)  Options have been
added to allow more control over how the data is extended before filtering.

Additional decomposition options (``scipy.linalg``)
---------------------------------------------------

A sort keyword has been added to the Schur decomposition routine 
(``scipy.linalg.schur``) to allow the sorting of eigenvalues in
the resultant Schur form.

Additional special matrices (``scipy.linalg``)
----------------------------------------------

The functions ``hilbert`` and ``invhilbert`` were added to ``scipy.linalg``.


Enhancements to ``scipy.stats``
-------------------------------

* The *one-sided form* of Fisher's exact test is now also implemented in
  ``stats.fisher_exact``. 
* The function ``stats.chi2_contingency`` for computing the chi-square test of
  independence of factors in a contingency table has been added, along with
  the related utility functions ``stats.contingency.margins`` and
  ``stats.contingency.expected_freq``.


Basic support for Harwell-Boeing file format for sparse matrices
----------------------------------------------------------------

Both read and write are support through a simple function-based API, as well as
a more complete API to control number format. The functions may be found in
scipy.sparse.io.

The following features are supported:

    * Read and write sparse matrices in the CSC format
    * Only real, symmetric, assembled matrix are supported (RUA format)


Deprecated features
===================

``scipy.maxentropy``
--------------------

The maxentropy module is unmaintained, rarely used and has not been functioning
well for several releases.  Therefore it has been deprecated for this release,
and will be removed for scipy 0.11.  Logistic regression in scikits.learn is a
good alternative for this functionality.  The ``scipy.maxentropy.logsumexp``
function has been moved to ``scipy.misc``.


``scipy.lib.blas``
------------------

There are similar BLAS wrappers in ``scipy.linalg`` and ``scipy.lib``.  These
have now been consolidated as ``scipy.linalg.blas``, and ``scipy.lib.blas`` is
deprecated.


Removed features
================

The deprecated name `invnorm` was removed from ``scipy.stats.distributions``,
this distribution is available as `invgauss`.

The following deprecated nonlinear solvers from ``scipy.optimize`` have been
removed::

  - ``broyden_modified`` (bad performance)
  - ``broyden1_modified`` (bad performance)
  - ``broyden_generalized`` (equivalent to ``anderson``)
  - ``anderson2`` (equivalent to ``anderson``)
  - ``broyden3`` (obsoleted by new limited-memory broyden methods)
  - ``vackar`` (renamed to ``diagbroyden``)
