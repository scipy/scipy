SciPy 0.15.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.15.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.15.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.15.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.3 and NumPy 1.5.1 or greater.


New features
============

``scipy.optimize`` improvements
-------------------------------

Linear Programming Interface
````````````````````````````

``scipy.optimize.linprog`` now provides a generic
linear programming similar to the way `scipy.optimize.minimize`
provides a generic interface to nonlinear programming optimizers.
Currently the only method supported is *simplex* which provides
a two-phase, dense-matrix-based simplex algorithm. Callbacks
functions are supported,allowing the user to monitor the progress
of the algorithm.

differential_evolution, a global optimization function
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The `differential_evolution` function is available from the ``scipy.optimize``
module.  Differential Evolution is an algorithm used for finding the global
minimum of multivariate functions. It is stochastic in nature (does not use
gradient methods), and can search large areas of candidate space, but often
requires larger numbers of function evaluations than conventional gradient
based techniques.

``scipy.signal`` improvements
-----------------------------
The function ``max_len_seq`` was added, which computes a Maximum
Length Sequence (MLS) signal.

``scipy.integrate`` improvements
--------------------------------
The interface between the scipy.integrate module and the QUADPACK library was 
redesigned. It is now possible to use scipy.integrate to integrate 
multivariate ctypes functions, thus avoiding callbacks to Python and providing 
better performance, especially for complex integrand functions.

``scipy.stats`` improvements
----------------------------
Added a Dirichlet distribution as multivariate distribution.

The new function `scipy.stats.median_test` computes Mood's median test.


Deprecated features
===================

The ``scipy.weave`` module is deprecated.  It was the only module never ported
to Python 3.x, and is not recommended to be used for new code - use Cython
instead.  In order to support existing code, ``scipy.weave`` has been packaged
separately: `https://github.com/scipy/weave`_.  It is a pure Python package, so
can easily be installed with ``pip install weave``.

``scipy.special.bessel_diff_formula`` is deprecated.  It is a private function,
and therefore will be removed from the public API in a following release.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

scipy.ndimage
-------------

The functions ``scipy.ndimage.minimum_positions``,
``scipy.ndimage.maximum_positions`` and ``scipy.ndimage.extrema`` return
positions as ints instead of floats.


Other changes
=============

scipy.integrate
---------------

The OPTPACK and QUADPACK code has been changed to use the LAPACK matrix
solvers rather than the bundled LINPACK code. This means that there is no
longer any need for the bundled LINPACK routines, so they have been removed.
