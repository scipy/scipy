SciPy 0.19.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.20.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.7 or 3.4-3.5 and NumPy 1.7.1 or greater.

`seed`, which can be used to seed the random number generator and obtain
repeatable minimizations.

`scipy.signal` improvements

The function `scipy.signal.sosfreqz` was added to compute the frequency
response from second-order sections.
