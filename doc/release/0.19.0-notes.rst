==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.19.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.19.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.20.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.7 or 3.4-3.5 and NumPy 1.7.1 or greater.



New features
============

`scipy.ndimage` improvements
----------------------------

The callback function C API supports PyCapsules in Python 2.7

`scipy.optimize` improvements
-----------------------------

The `scipy.optimize.basinhopping` global minimizer obtained a new keyword,
`seed`, which can be used to seed the random number generator and obtain
repeatable minimizations.

The keyword `sigma` in `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` was overloaded to also accept
the covariance matrix of errors in the data.

`scipy.signal` improvements
---------------------------

The function `scipy.signal.sosfreqz` was added to compute the frequency
response from second-order sections.

The function `scipy.signal.unit_impulse` was added to conveniently
generate an impulse function.

`scipy.sparse` improvements
---------------------------

The functions `scipy.sparse.save_npz` and `scipy.sparse.load_npz` were added,
providing simple serialization for some sparse formats.
