SciPy 0.19.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.19.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.19.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.20.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.7 or 3.4-3.5 and NumPy 1.8.2 or greater.



New features
============

`scipy.ndimage` improvements
----------------------------

The callback function C API supports PyCapsules in Python 2.7

`scipy.optimize` improvements
-----------------------------

The `scipy.optimize.basinhopping` global minimizer obtained a new keyword,
`seed`, which can be used to seed the random number generator and obtain
repeatable minimizations.

The keyword `sigma` in `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` was overloaded to also accept
the covariance matrix of errors in the data.

`scipy.signal` improvements
---------------------------

The function `scipy.signal.sosfreqz` was added to compute the frequency
response from second-order sections.

The function `scipy.signal.unit_impulse` was added to conveniently
generate an impulse function.

The function `scipy.signal.irrnotch` was added to design second-order
IIR notch filters that can be used to remove a frequency component from
a signal. The dual function  `scipy.signal.irrpeak` was added to
compute the coeficients of a second-order IIR peak (resonant) filter.

`scipy.sparse` improvements
---------------------------

The functions `scipy.sparse.save_npz` and `scipy.sparse.load_npz` were added,
providing simple serialization for some sparse formats.

`scipy.special` improvements
----------------------------

The names of orthogonal polynomial root functions have been changed to
be consistent with other functions relating to orthogonal
polynomials. For example, `scipy.special.j_roots` has been renamed
`scipy.special.roots_jacobi` for consistency with the related
functions `scipy.special.jacobi` and `scipy.special.eval_jacobi`. To
preserve back-compatibility the old names have been left as aliases.

`scipy.interpolate` improvements
--------------------------------

New class ``scipy.interpolate.BSpline`` represents splines. ``BSpline`` objects
contain knots and coefficients and can evaluate the spline. The format is
consistent with FITPACK, so that one can do, for example::

    >>> t, c, k = splrep(x, y, s=0)
    >>> spl = BSpline(t, c, k)
    >>> np.allclose(spl(x), y)

``spl*`` functions, `scipy.interpolate.splev`, `scipy.interpolate.splint`,
`scipy.interpolate.splder` and `scipy.interpolate.splantider`, accept both
``BSpline`` objects and ``(t, c, k)`` tuples for backwards compatibility.

For multidimensional splines, ``c.ndim > 1``, ``BSpline`` objects are consistent
with piecewise polynomials, `scipy.interpolate.PPoly`. This means that
``BSpline`` objects are not immediately consistent with
`scipy.interpolate.splprep`, and one *cannot* do 
``>>> BSpline(*splprep([x, y])[0])``. Consult the `scipy.interpolate` test suite
for examples of the precise equivalence.

In new code, prefer using ``scipy.interpolate.BSpline`` objects instead of
manipulating ``(t, c, k)`` tuples directly.

New function `scipy.interpolate.make_interp_spline` constructs an interpolating
spline given data points and boundary conditions.

New function `scipy.interpolate.make_lsq_spline` constructs a least-squares
spline approximation given data points.


Deprecated features
===================

`scipy.interpolate.splmake`, `scipy.interpolate.spleval` and
`scipy.interpolate.spline` are deprecated. The format used by `splmake/spleval`
was inconsistent with `splrep/splev` which was confusing to users.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

The deprecated ``scipy.weave`` submodule was removed.

`scipy.spatial.distance.squareform` now returns arrays of the same dtype as
the input, instead of always float64.

`scipy.special.errprint` now returns a boolean.

The function `scipy.signal.find_peaks_cwt()` now returns an array instead of
a list.


Other changes
=============

SciPy wheels will now report their dependency on ``numpy`` on all platforms.
This change was made because Numpy wheels are available, and because the pip
upgrade behavior is finally changing for the better (use
``--upgrade-strategy=only-if-needed`` for ``pip >= 8.2``; that behavior will
become the default in the next major version of ``pip``).

Numerical values returned by `scipy.interpolate.interp1d` with ``kind="cubic"``
and ``"quadratic"`` may change relative to previous scipy versions. If your
code depended on specific numeric values (i.e., on implementation
details of the interpolators), you may want to double-check your results.
