SciPy 1.1.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 1.1.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 1.1.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Before upgrading, we recommend that users
check that their own code does not use deprecated SciPy functionality
(to do so, run your code with ``python -Wd`` and check for
``DeprecationWarning`` s).  Our development attention will now shift to
bug-fix releases on the 1.0.x branch, and on adding new features on the
master branch.


This release requires Python 2.7 or 3.4+ and NumPy 1.8.2 or greater.


New features
============

`scipy.linalg` improvements
----------------------------

The function `scipy.linalg.ldl` has been added for factorization of
indefinite symmetric/hermitian matrices into triangular and block
diagonal matrices.


Deprecated features
===================


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

Previously, ``scipy.linalg.orth`` used a singular value cutoff value
appropriate for double precision numbers also for single-precision
input. The cutoff value is now tunable, and the default has been
changed to depend on the input data precision.
