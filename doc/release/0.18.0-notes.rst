SciPy 0.18.0 Release Notes
==========================

.. note:: Scipy 0.18.0 is not released yet!

.. contents::

SciPy 0.18.0 is the culmination of X months of hard work. It contains
many new features, numerous bug-fixes, improved test coverage and
better documentation.  There have been a number of deprecations and
API changes in this release, which are documented below.  All users
are encouraged to upgrade to this release, as there are a large number
of bug-fixes and optimizations.  Moreover, our development attention
will now shift to bug-fix releases on the 0.18.x branch, and on adding
new features on the master branch.

This release requires Python 2.6, 2.7 or 3.2-3.4 and NumPy 1.6.2 or greater.


New features
============

Discrete-time linear systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`scipy.linalg.dlti` provides an implementation of discrete-time linear systems.
Accordingly, the `StateSpace`, `TransferFunction` and `ZerosPolesGain` classes
have learned a the new keyword, `dt`, which can be used to create discrete-time
instances of the corresponding system representation.

Random matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`scipy.stats.special_ortho_group` and `scipy.stats.ortho_group` provide
generators of random matrices in the SO(N) and O(N) groups, respectively. They
generate matrices in the Haar distribution, the only uniform distribution on
these group manifolds.

`scipy.stats.random_correlation` provides a generator for random
correlation matrices, given specified eigenvalues.

`scipy.integrate` improvements
------------------------------

A solver of two-point boundary value problems for ODE systems has been
implemented in `scipy.integrate.solve_bvp`. The solver allows for non-separated
boundary conditions, unknown parameters and certain singular terms. It finds
a C1 continious solution using a fourth-order collocation algorithm.

`scipy.interpolate` improvements
--------------------------------

Cubic spline interpolation is now available via `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline`.
This class represents a piecewise cubic polynomial passing through given points
and C2 continuous. It is represented in the standard polynomial basis on each
segment.

`scipy.signal` improvements
---------------------------

Resampling using polyphase filtering has been implemented in the function
`scipy.signal.resample_poly`. This method upsamples a signal, applies a
zero-phase low-pass FIR filter, and downsamples using `scipy.signal.upfirdn`.
This method can be faster than FFT-based filtering provided by
`scipy.signal.resample` for some signals.

`scipy.sparse` compatibility improvements
-----------------------------------------

The functions `sum`, `max`, `mean`, `min`, `transpose`, and `reshape` in
`scipy.sparse` have had their signatures augmented with additional arguments
and functionality so as to improve compatibility with analogously defined
functions in `numpy`.


Deprecated features
===================


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

The convergence criterion for ``optimize.bisect``,
``optimize.brentq``, ``optimize.brenth``, and ``optimize.ridder`` now
works the same as ``numpy.allclose``.

The offset in ``ndimage.iterpolation.affine_transform``
is now consistently added after the matrix is applied,
independent of if the matrix is specified using a one-dimensional
or a two-dimensional array.

``stats.ks_2samp`` used to return nonsensical values if the input was
not real or contained nans.  It now raises an exception for such inputs.

`scipy.io.netcdf` masking now gives precedence to the ``_FillValue`` attribute
over the ``missing_value`` attribute, if both are given. Also, data are only
treated as missing if they match one of these attributes exactly: values that
differ by roundoff from ``_FillValue`` or ``missing_value`` are no longer
treated as missing values.


Other changes
=============

Scipy now uses ``setuptools`` for its builds instead of plain distutils.  This
fixes usage of ``install_requires='scipy'`` in the ``setup.py`` files of
projects that depend on Scipy (see Numpy issue gh-6551 for details).  It
potentially affects the way that build/install methods for Scipy itself behave
though.  Please report any unexpected behavior on the Scipy issue tracker.

PR `#6240 <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/6240>`__
changes the interpretation of the `maxfun` option in `L-BFGS-B` based routines
in the `scipy.optimize` module.
An `L-BFGS-B` search consists of multiple iterations,
with each iteration consisting of one or more function evaluations.
Whereas the old search strategy terminated immediately upon reaching `maxfun`
function evaluations, the new strategy allows the current iteration
to finish despite reaching `maxfun`.
