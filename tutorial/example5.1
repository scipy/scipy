 Optimization Tools

A collection of general-purpose optimization routines.

  fmin --      Nelder-Mead Simplex algorithm
               (uses only function calls)
  fminBFGS --  Quasi-Newton method (can use function and gradient)
  fminNCG --   Line-search Newton Conjugate Gradient (can use
               function, gradient and hessian).
  leastsq --   Minimize the sum of squares of M equations in
                N unknowns given a starting estimate.
  fminbound -- Bounded minimization of a scalar function.
  fsolve --    Non-linear equation solver.
