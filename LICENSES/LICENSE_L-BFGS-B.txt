The advertising clause was removed from the license text in the official BSD on July 22, 1999 by William Hoskins, Director of 
the Office of Technology Licensing for UC Berkeley.[8] Other BSD distributions removed the clause, but many similar clauses 
remain in BSD-derived code from other sources, and unrelated code using a derived license.

While the original license is sometimes referred to as "BSD-old", the resulting 3-clause version is sometimes referred to by 
"BSD-new." Other names include "New BSD", "revised BSD", "BSD-3", or "3-clause BSD". This version has been vetted as 
an Open source license by the OSI as the "The BSD License".[3] The Free Software Foundation, which refers to the license 
as the "Modified BSD License", states that it is compatible with the GNU GPL. The FSF encourages users to be specific 
when referring to the license by name (i.e. not simply referring to it as "a BSD license" or "BSD-style") to avoid confusion with 
the original BSD license.[1]

This version allows unlimited redistribution for any purpose as long as its copyright notices and the license's disclaimers of 
warranty are maintained. The license also contains a clause restricting use of the names of contributors for endorsement of a 
derived work without specific permission.
