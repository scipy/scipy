/*
   Use a combination of bisection and false position to find a root
   of a function within a given interval. This is guaranteed to converge,
   and always keeps a bounding interval, unlike Newton's method.

   The false position steps are either unmodified, or modified with
   the Anderson-Bjorck method as appropriate. Theoretically, this has
   a "speed of convergence" of 1.7 (bisection is 1, Newton is 2).

   Input
   -----
    a, b:   initial bounding interval
    fa, fb: value of f() at a and b
    f, f_extra: function to find root of is f(x, f_extra)
    abserr, relerr: absolute and relative errors on the bounding interval
    bisect_til: If > 0.0, perform bisection until the width of the
                bounding interval is less than this.

   Output
   ------
    a, b, fa, fb: Final bounding interval and function values
    best_x, best_f: Best root approximation and the function value there

   Returns
   -------
    FSOLVE_CONVERGED: Bounding interval is smaller than required error.
    FSOLVE_NOT_BRACKET: Initial interval is not a bounding interval.
    FSOLVE_EXACT: An exact root was found (best_f = 0)


   Note that this routine was designed initially to work with gammaincinv, so
   it may not be tuned right for other problems. Don't use it blindly.
