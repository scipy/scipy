Implementation Overview

The inverse of the CDF of the standard normal distribution is available
in scipy through the Cephes Math Library where it is called ndtri.
We call our implementation of the inverse of the log CDF ndtri_exp.
For -2 <= y <= log(1 - exp(-2)),  ndtri_exp is computed as ndtri(exp(y)).

For 0 < p < exp(-2), the cephes implementation of ndtri uses an approximation
for ndtri(p) which is a function of z = sqrt(-2.0 * log(p)). Letting
y = log(p), for y < -2, ndtri_exp uses this approximation in log(p) directly.
This allows the implementation to achieve high precision for very small y,
whereas ndtri(exp(y)) evaluates to infinity. This is because  exp(y) underflows
for y < ~ -745.1.

When p > 1 - exp(-2), the Cephes implementation of ndtri uses the symmetry
of the normal distribution and calculates ndtri(p) as -ndtri(1 - p) allowing
for the use of the same approximation. When y > log(1 - exp(-2)) this
implementation calculates ndtri_exp as -ndtri(-exp1m(y)).


Accuracy

Cephes provides the following relative error estimates for ndtri
                     Relative error:
arithmetic   domain        # trials      peak         rms
   IEEE     0.125, 1        20000       7.2e-16     1.3e-16
   IEEE     3e-308, 0.135   50000       4.6e-16     9.8e-17

When y < -2, ndtri_exp must have relative error at least as small as the
Cephes implementation of ndtri for p < exp(-2). It relies on the same
approximation but does not have to lose precision by passing from p to log(p)
before applying the approximation.

Relative error of ndtri for values of the argument p near 1 can be much higher
than claimed by the above chart. For p near 1, symmetry is exploited to
replace the calculation of ndtri(p) with -ndtri(1 - p). The inverse of the
normal CDF increases so rapidly near the endpoints of [0, 1] that the loss
of precision incurred by the subtraction 1 - p due to limitations in binary
approximation can make a significant difference in the results. Using
version 9.3.0 targeting x86_64-linux-gnu we've observed the following

                                              Estimated Relative Error
 ndtri(1e-8)      = -5.612001244174789        ''
-ndtri(1 - 1e-8)  = -5.612001243305505        1.55e-10
 ndtri(1e-16)     = -8.222082216130435        ''
-ndtri(1 - 1e-16) = -8.209536151601387        0.0015

If expm1 is correctly rounded for y in [log(1 - exp(-2), 0), then ndtri_exp(y)
should have the same relative error as ndtri(p) for p > 1 - exp(-2). As seen
above, this error may be higher than desired. IEEE-754 provides no guarantee on
the accuracy of expm1 however, therefore accuracy of ndtri_exp in this range
is platform dependent.

The case

    -2 <= y <= log(1 - exp(-2)) ~ -0.1454

corresponds to

     ~ 0.135 <= p <= ~ 0.865

The derivative of ndtri is sqrt(2 * pi) * exp(ndtri(x)**2 / 2).
It is ~4.597 at x ~ 0.135, decreases monotonically to sqrt(2 * pi) ~ 2.507
at x = 0 and increases monotonically again to ~4.597 at x ~ 0.865.

It can be checked that all higher derivatives follow a similar pattern.
Their absolute value takes on a maximum (for this interval) at x ~ 0.135,
decrease to a minimum at x = 0 and increases to the same maximum at x ~ 0.865.
Derivatives of all orders are positive at x=log(1 - exp(-2)). Thus the worst
possible loss of precision of ndtri(exp(x)) in the interval
[0, log(1 - exp(-2))] due to error in calculating exp(x) must occur near
x=log(1 - exp(-2)). By symmetry, the worst possible loss of precision in
[-2, log(1 - exp(-2)] must occur near the endpoints. We may observe
empirically that error at the endpoints due to exp is not substantial.
Assuming that exp is accurate within +-ULP (unit of least precision),
we observed a value of at most ~6.0474e-16 for

    abs(ndtri(x + epsilon) - ndtri(x))

if x is near exp(-2) or 1 - exp(-2) and epsilon is equal to the unit of least
precision of x.

(IEEE-754 provides no guarantee on the accuracy of exp, but for most
compilers on most architectures an assumption of +-ULP should be
reasonable.)

The error here is on the order of the error in the Cephes implementation of
ndtri itself, leading to an error profile that is still favorable.
