    Sequence of associated Legendre functions of the first kind.

    Computes the associated Legendre function of the first kind of order m and
    degree n, ``Pmn(z)`` = :math:`P_n^m(z)`, and its derivative, ``Pmn'(z)``.
    Returns two arrays of size ``(m+1, n+1)`` containing ``Pmn(z)`` and
    ``Pmn'(z)`` for all orders from ``0..m`` and degrees from ``0..n``.

    This function takes a real argument ``z``. For complex arguments ``z``
    use clpmn instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z : array_like
        Input value.
    m : array_like
        Sign of the order m.

    Returns
    -------
    Pmn_z : (m+1, n+1) array
       Values for all orders 0..m and degrees 0..n
    Pmn_d_z : (m+1, n+1) array
       Derivatives for all orders 0..m and degrees 0..n

    Notes
    -----
    In the interval (-1, 1), Ferrer's function of the first kind is
    returned. The phase convention used for the intervals (1, inf)
    and (-inf, -1) is such that the result is always real.

    Computes the associated Legendre function of the first kind of order m and

    Returns two arrays of size ``(m+1, n+1)`` containing ``Pmn(z)`` and

    Notes
    -----
    By default, i.e. for ``type=3``, phase conventions are chosen according
    to [1]_ such that the function is analytic. The cut lies on the interval
    (-1, 1). Approaching the cut from above or below in general yields a phase
    factor with respect to Ferrer's function of the first kind
    (cf. `lpmn`).

    For ``type=2`` a cut at ``|x| > 1`` is chosen. Approaching the real values
    on the interval (-1, 1) in the complex plane yields Ferrer's function
    of the first kind.
