 *
 *     Round double to nearest or even integer valued double
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * double x, y, round();
 *
 * y = round(x);
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Returns the nearest integer to x as a double precision
 * floating point result.  If x ends in 0.5 exactly, the
 * nearest even integer is chosen.
 * 
 *
 *
 * ACCURACY:
 *
 * If x is greater than 1/(2*MACHEP), its closest machine
 * representation is already an integer, so rounding does
 * not change it.
