 *
 *     Common include file for math routines
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * #include "mconf.h"
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * This file contains definitions for error codes that are
 * passed to the common error handling routine mtherr()
 * (which see).
 *
 * The file also includes a conditional assembly definition
 * for the type of computer arithmetic (IEEE, DEC, Motorola
 * IEEE, or UNKnown).
 * 
 * For Digital Equipment PDP-11 and VAX computers, certain
 * IBM systems, and others that use numbers with a 56-bit
 * significand, the symbol DEC should be defined.  In this
 * mode, most floating point constants are given as arrays
 * of octal integers to eliminate decimal to binary conversion
 * errors that might be introduced by the compiler.
 *
 * For little-endian computers, such as IBM PC, that follow the
 * IEEE Standard for Binary Floating Point Arithmetic (ANSI/IEEE
 * Std 754-1985), the symbol IBMPC should be defined.  These
 * numbers have 53-bit significands.  In this mode, constants
 * are provided as arrays of hexadecimal 16 bit integers.
 *
 * Big-endian IEEE format is denoted MIEEE.  On some RISC
 * systems such as Sun SPARC, double precision constants
 * must be stored on 8-byte address boundaries.  Since integer
 * arrays may be aligned differently, the MIEEE configuration
 * may fail on such machines.
 *
 * To accommodate other types of computer arithmetic, all
 * constants are also provided in a normal decimal radix
 * which one can hope are correctly converted to a suitable
 * format by the available C language compiler.  To invoke
 * this mode, define the symbol UNK.
 *
 * An important difference among these modes is a predefined
 * set of machine arithmetic constants for each.  The numbers
 * MACHEP (the machine roundoff error), MAXNUM (largest number
 * represented), and several other parameters are preset by
 * the configuration symbol.  Check the file const.c to
 * ensure that these values are correct for your computer.
 *
 * Configurations NANS, INFINITIES, MINUSZERO, and DENORMAL
 * may fail on many systems.  Verify that they are supposed
 * to work on your computer.
