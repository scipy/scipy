        inline     -- a function for including C/C++ code within Python
        blitz      -- a function for compiling Numeric expressions to C++
        ext_tools  -- a module that helps construct C/C++ extension modules.
        accelerate -- a module that inline accelerates Python functions


.. note:: On Linux one needs to have the Python development headers installed
          in order to be able to compile things with the `weave` module.
          Since this is a runtime dependency these headers (typically in a
          pythonX.Y-dev package) are not always installed when installing
          scipy.
