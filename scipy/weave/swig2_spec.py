"""
This module allows one to use SWIG2 (SWIG version >= 1.3) wrapped
objects from Weave.  SWIG-1.3 wraps objects differently from SWIG-1.1.

This module is a template for a SWIG2 wrapped converter.  To wrap any
special code that uses SWIG the user simply needs to override the
defaults in the swig2_converter class.  These special circumstances
arise when one has wrapped code that uses C++ namespaces.  However,
for most straightforward SWIG wrappers this converter should work fine
out of the box.

Newer versions of SWIG (>=1.3.22) represent the wrapped object using a
PyCObject and also a PySwigObject (>=1.3.24).  This code supports all
of these options transparently.

Since SWIG-1.3.x is under intense development there are several issues
to consider when using the swig2_converter.

 1. For SWIG versions <= 1.3.19, the runtime code was built either
    into the module or into a separate library called libswigpy (or
    something like that).  In the latter case, the users Python
    modules were linked to this library and shared type information
    (this was common for large projects with several modules that
    needed to share type information).  If you are using multiple
    inheritance and want to be certain that type coercions from a
    derived class to a base class are done correctly, you will need to
    link to the libswigpy library.  You will then need to add these to
    the keyword arguments passed along to `weave.inline`:

      a. Add a define_macros=[('SWIG_NOINCLUDE', None)]

      b. Add the swigpy library to the libraries like so:
         libraries=['swigpy']

      c. If the libswigpy is in a non-standard location add the path
         to the library_dirs argument as
         `library_dirs=['/usr/local/lib']` or whatever.

    OTOH if you do not need to link to libswigpy (this is likely if
    you are not using multiple inheritance), then you do not need the
    above.  However you are likely to get an annoying message of the
    form::

      WARNING: swig_type_info is NULL.

    for each SWIG object you are inlining (during each call).  To
    avoid this add a define_macros=[('NO_SWIG_WARN', None)].

 2. Since keeping track of a separate runtime is a pain, for SWIG
    versions >= 1.3.23 the type information was stored inside a
    special module.  Thus in these versions there is no need to link
    to this special SWIG runtime library.  This module handles these
    cases automatically and nothing special need be done.

    Using modules wrapped with different SWIG versions simultaneously.
    Lets say you have library 'A' that is wrapped using SWIG version
    1.3.20.  Then lets say you have a library 'B' wrapped using
    version 1.3.24.  Now if you want to use both in weave.inline, we
    have a serious problem.  The trouble is that both 'A' and 'B' may
    use different and incompatible runtime layouts.  It is impossible
    to get the type conversions right in these cases.  Thus it is
    strongly advised that you use one version of SWIG to wrap all of
    the code that you intend to inline using weave.  Note that you can
    certainly use SWIG-1.3.23 for everything and do not have to use
    the latest and greatest SWIG to use weave.inline.  Just make sure
    that when inlining SWIG wrapped objects that all such objects use
    the same runtime layout.  By default, if you are using different
    versions and do need to inline these objects, the latest layout
    will be assumed.  This might leave you with holes in your feet,
    but you have been warned.  You can force the converter to use a
    specific runtime version if you want (see the
    `swig2_converter.__init__` method and its documentation).
