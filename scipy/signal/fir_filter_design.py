# Some notes on function parameters:
#
# `cutoff` and `width` are given as a numbers between 0 and 1.  These
# are relative frequencies, expressed as a fraction of the Nyquist rate.
# For example, if the Nyquist rate is 2KHz, then width=0.15 is a width
# of 300 Hz.
#
# The `order` of a FIR filter is one less than the number of taps.
# This is a potential source of confusion, so in the following code,
# we will always use the number of taps as the parameterization of
# the 'size' of the filter. The "number of taps" means the number
# of coefficients, which is the same as the length of the impulse
# response of the filter.

    FIR filter design using the window method.

    This function computes the coefficients of a finite impulse response
    filter.  The filter will have linear phase; it will be Type I if
    `numtaps` is odd and Type II if `numtaps` is even.

    Type II filters always have zero response at the Nyquist rate, so a
    ValueError exception is raised if firwin is called with `numtaps` even and
    having a passband whose right end is at the Nyquist rate.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numtaps : int
        Length of the filter (number of coefficients, i.e. the filter
        order + 1).  `numtaps` must be even if a passband includes the
        Nyquist frequency.

    cutoff : float or 1D array_like
        Cutoff frequency of filter (expressed in the same units as `nyq`)
        OR an array of cutoff frequencies (that is, band edges). In the
        latter case, the frequencies in `cutoff` should be positive and
        monotonically increasing between 0 and `nyq`.  The values 0 and
        `nyq` must not be included in `cutoff`.

    width : float or None
        If `width` is not None, then assume it is the approximate width
        of the transition region (expressed in the same units as `nyq`)
        for use in Kaiser FIR filter design.  In this case, the `window`
        argument is ignored.

    window : string or tuple of string and parameter values
        Desired window to use. See `scipy.signal.get_window` for a list
        of windows and required parameters.

    pass_zero : bool
        If True, the gain at the frequency 0 (i.e. the "DC gain") is 1.
        Otherwise the DC gain is 0.

    scale : bool
        Set to True to scale the coefficients so that the frequency
        response is exactly unity at a certain frequency.
        That frequency is either:
            0 (DC) if the first passband starts at 0 (i.e. pass_zero
                is True);
            `nyq` (the Nyquist rate) if the first passband ends at
                `nyq` (i.e the filter is a single band highpass filter);
            center of first passband otherwise.

    nyq : float
        Nyquist frequency.  Each frequency in `cutoff` must be between 0
        and `nyq`.

    Returns
    -------
    h : 1D ndarray
        Coefficients of length `numtaps` FIR filter.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If any value in `cutoff` is less than or equal to 0 or greater
        than or equal to `nyq`, if the values in `cutoff` are not strictly
        monotonically increasing, or if `numtaps` is even but a passband
        includes the Nyquist frequency.

    Examples
    --------

    Low-pass from 0 to f::

    >>> firwin(numtaps, f)

    Use a specific window function::

    >>> firwin(numtaps, f, window='nuttall')

    >>> firwin(numtaps, f, pass_zero=False)

    Band-pass::

def firwin2(numtaps, freq, gain, nfreqs=None, window='hamming', nyq=1.0, antisymmetric=False):
    """FIR filter design using the window method.

    From the given frequencies `freq` and corresponding gains `gain`,
    this function constructs an FIR filter with linear phase and
    (approximately) the given frequency response.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numtaps : int
        The number of taps in the FIR filter.  `numtaps` must be less than
        `nfreqs`.

    freq : array-like, 1D
        The frequency sampling points. Typically 0.0 to 1.0 with 1.0 being
        Nyquist.  The Nyquist frequency can be redefined with the argument
        `nyq`.

        The values in `freq` must be nondecreasing.  A value can be repeated
        once to implement a discontinuity.  The first value in `freq` must
        be 0, and the last value must be `nyq`.

    gain : array-like
        The filter gains at the frequency sampling points. Certain
        constraints to gain values, depending on the filter type, are applied,
        see Notes for details.

    nfreqs : int, optional
        The size of the interpolation mesh used to construct the filter.
        For most efficient behavior, this should be a power of 2 plus 1
        (e.g, 129, 257, etc).  The default is one more than the smallest
        power of 2 that is not less than `numtaps`.  `nfreqs` must be greater
        than `numtaps`.

    window : string or (string, float) or float, or None, optional
        Window function to use. Default is "hamming".  See
        `scipy.signal.get_window` for the complete list of possible values.
        If None, no window function is applied.

    nyq : float
        Nyquist frequency.  Each frequency in `freq` must be between 0 and
        `nyq` (inclusive).

    antisymmetric : bool
        Flag setting wither resulting impulse responce is symmetric/antisymmetric.
        See Notes for more details.

    Returns
    -------
    taps : numpy 1D array of length `numtaps`
        The filter coefficients of the FIR filter.

    Examples
    --------
    A lowpass FIR filter with a response that is 1 on [0.0, 0.5], and
    that decreases linearly on [0.5, 1.0] from 1 to 0:

    >>> taps = firwin2(150, [0.0, 0.5, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0])
    >>> print(taps[72:78])
    [-0.02286961 -0.06362756  0.57310236  0.57310236 -0.06362756 -0.02286961]

    See also
    --------
    scipy.signal.firwin

    Notes
    -----

    From the given set of frequencies and gains, the desired response is
    constructed in the frequency domain.  The inverse FFT is applied to the
    desired response to create the associated convolution kernel, and the
    first `numtaps` coefficients of this kernel, scaled by `window`, are
    returned.

    The FIR filter will have linear phase. The type of filter is determined by
    the value of 'numtaps` and `antisymmetric` flag.
    There are four possible combinations:
       - odd  `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is False, type I filter is produced
       - even `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is False, type II filter is produced
       - odd  `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is True, type III filter is produced
       - even `numtaps`, `antisymmetric` is True, type IV filter is produced

    Magnitude response of all but type I filters are subjects to following
    constraints:
       - type II  -- zero at the Nyquist frequency
       - type III -- zero at zero and Nyquist frequencies
       - type IV  -- zero at zero frequency
