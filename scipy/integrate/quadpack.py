Extra information for quad() inputs and outputs:

  If full_output is non-zero, then the third output argument (infodict)
  is a dictionary with entries as tabulated below.  For infinite limits, the
  range is transformed to (0,1) and the optional outputs are given with
  respect to this transformed range.  Let M be the input argument limit and
  let K be infodict['last'].  The entries are:

  'neval' : The number of function evaluations.
  'last'  : The number, K, of subintervals produced in the subdivision process.
  'alist' : A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the
            left end points of the subintervals in the partition of the
            integration range.
  'blist' : A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the
            right end points of the subintervals.
  'rlist' : A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the
            integral approximations on the subintervals.
  'elist' : A rank-1 array of length M, the first K elements of which are the
            moduli of the absolute error estimates on the subintervals.
  'iord'  : A rank-1 integer array of length M, the first L elements of
            which are pointers to the error estimates over the subintervals
            with L=K if K<=M/2+2 or L=M+1-K otherwise. Let I be the sequence
            infodict['iord'] and let E be the sequence infodict['elist'].
            Then E[I[1]], ..., E[I[L]] forms a decreasing sequence.

  If the input argument points is provided (i.e. it is not None), the
  following additional outputs are placed in the output dictionary.  Assume the
  points sequence is of length P.

  'pts'   : A rank-1 array of length P+2 containing the integration limits
            and the break points of the intervals in ascending order.
            This is an array giving the subintervals over which integration
            will occur.
  'level' : A rank-1 integer array of length M (=limit), containing the
            subdivision levels of the subintervals, i.e., if (aa,bb) is a
            subinterval of (pts[1], pts[2]) where pts[0] and pts[2] are
            adjacent elements of infodict['pts'], then (aa,bb) has level l if
            |bb-aa|=|pts[2]-pts[1]| * 2**(-l).
  'ndin'  : A rank-1 integer array of length P+2.  After the first integration
            over the intervals (pts[1], pts[2]), the error estimates over some
            of the intervals may have been increased artificially in order to
            put their subdivision forward.  This array has ones in slots
            corresponding to the subintervals for which this happens.

Weighting the integrand:

  The input variables, weight and wvar, are used to weight the integrand by
  a select list of functions.  Different integration methods are used
  to compute the integral with these weighting functions.  The possible values
  of weight and the corresponding weighting functions are.

  'cos'     : cos(w*x)                            : wvar = w
  'sin'     : sin(w*x)                            : wvar = w
  'alg'     : g(x) = ((x-a)**alpha)*((b-x)**beta) : wvar = (alpha, beta)
  'alg-loga': g(x)*log(x-a)                       : wvar = (alpha, beta)
  'alg-logb': g(x)*log(b-x)                       : wvar = (alpha, beta)
  'alg-log' : g(x)*log(x-a)*log(b-x)              : wvar = (alpha, beta)
  'cauchy'  : 1/(x-c)                             : wvar = c

  wvar holds the parameter w, (alpha, beta), or c depending on the weight
  selected.  In these expressions, a and b are the integration limits.

  For the 'cos' and 'sin' weighting, additional inputs and outputs are
  available.

  For finite integration limits, the integration is performed using a
  Clenshaw-Curtis method which uses Chebyshev moments.  For repeated
  calculations, these moments are saved in the output dictionary:

  'momcom' : The maximum level of Chebyshev moments that have been computed,
             i.e., if M_c is infodict['momcom'] then the moments have been
             computed for intervals of length |b-a|* 2**(-l), l=0,1,...,M_c.
  'nnlog'  : A rank-1 integer array of length M(=limit), containing the
             subdivision levels of the subintervals, i.e., an element of this
             array is equal to l if the corresponding subinterval is
             |b-a|* 2**(-l).
  'chebmo' : A rank-2 array of shape (25, maxp1) containing the computed
             Chebyshev moments.  These can be passed on to an integration
             over the same interval by passing this array as the second
             element of the sequence wopts and passing infodict['momcom'] as
             the first element.

  If one of the integration limits is infinite, then a Fourier integral is
  computed (assuming w neq 0).  If full_output is 1 and a numerical error
  is encountered, besides the error message attached to the output tuple,
  a dictionary is also appended to the output tuple which translates the
  error codes in the array info['ierlst'] to English messages.  The output
  information dictionary contains the following entries instead of 'last',
  'alist', 'blist', 'rlist', and 'elist':

  'lst'    : The number of subintervals needed for the integration (call it K_f).
  'rslst'  : A rank-1 array of length M_f=limlst, whose first K_f elements
             contain the integral contribution over the interval (a+(k-1)c,
             a+kc) where c = (2*floor(|w|) + 1) * pi / |w| and k=1,2,...,K_f.
  'erlst'  : A rank-1 array of length M_f containing the error estimate
             corresponding to the interval in the same position in
             infodict['rslist'].
  'ierlst' : A rank-1 integer array of length M_f containing an error flag
             corresponding to the interval in the same position in
             infodict['rslist'].  See the explanation dictionary (last entry
             in the output tuple) for the meaning of the codes.
