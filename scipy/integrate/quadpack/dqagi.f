c                     estimate of the modulus of the absolute error,

c                             has been achieved. one can allow more
c                             subdivisions by increasing the value of
c                             limit (and taking the according dimension
c                             adjustments into account). however, if
c                             this yields no improvement it is advised
c                             to analyze the integrand in order to
c                             determine the integration difficulties. if
c                             the position of a local difficulty can be
c                             determined (e.g. singularity,
c                             discontinuity within the interval) one
c                             will probably gain from splitting up the
c                             interval at this point and calling the
c                             integrator on the subranges. if possible,
c                             an appropriate special-purpose integrator
c                             should be used, which is designed for
c                             handling the type of difficulty involved.
c                         = 2 the occurrence of roundoff error is
c                             detected, which prevents the requested
c                             tolerance from being achieved.
c                             the error may be under-estimated.
c                         = 3 extremely bad integrand behaviour occurs
c                             at some points of the integration
c                             interval.
c                         = 4 the algorithm does not converge.
c                             roundoff error is detected in the
c                             extrapolation table.
c                             it is assumed that the requested tolerance
c                             cannot be achieved, and that the returned
c                             result is the best which can be obtained.
c                         = 5 the integral is probably divergent, or
c                             slowly convergent. it must be noted that
c                             divergence can occur with any other value
c                             of ier.
