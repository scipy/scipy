MINPACK library is a C translation of the Fortran77 code written by Jorge J. Moré,
Burton S. Garbow, and Kenneth E. Hillstrom, with the original description below.
Original Fortran docstrings are included at the top of each function.

* Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and nonlinear
* least squares problems.  Five algorithmic paths each include a core
* subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  The algorithms proceed either from
* an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or directly from the
* problem functions.  The paths include facilities forsystems of equations
* with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares problems with a large
* amount of data, and for checking the consistency of the Jacobian matrix
* with the functions.
