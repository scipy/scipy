L-BFGS-B library is a C translation of the Fortran code written by Ciyou Zhu,
Richard Byrd, Jorge Nocedal and Jose Luis Morales with the original
description below.

Some of the functions have been modified and certain arguments are rendered
obsolete to be used in SciPy however original docstrings are kept at the top
of each function for reference.

 * ===========   L-BFGS-B (version 3.0.  April 25, 2011  ===================
 *
 *     This is a modified version of L-BFGS-B. Minor changes in the updated
 *     code appear preceded by a line comment as follows
 *
 *     c-jlm-jn
 *
 *     Major changes are described in the accompanying paper:
 *
 *         Jorge Nocedal and Jose Luis Morales, Remark on "Algorithm 778:
 *         L-BFGS-B: Fortran Subroutines for Large-Scale Bound Constrained
 *         Optimization"  (2011). To appear in  ACM Transactions on
 *         Mathematical Software,
 *
 *     The paper describes an improvement and a correction to Algorithm 778.
 *     It is shown that the performance of the algorithm can be improved
 *     significantly by making a relatively simple modication to the subspace
 *     minimization phase. The correction concerns an error caused by the use
 *     of routine dpmeps to estimate machine precision.
 *
 *     The total work space **wa** required by the new version is
 *
 *                  2*m*n + 11m*m + 5*n + 8*m
 *
 *     the old version required
 *
 *                  2*m*n + 12m*m + 4*n + 12*m
