Algorithm NNLS: NONNEGATIVE LEAST SQUARES

Given an m by n matrix A, an m-vector B, and an n-vector X, compute an
n-vector X which solves the least squares problem

            a * x = b  subject to x >= 0

NNLS library is a  C translation of the original Fortran77 code, which was
developed by Charles L. Lawson and Richard J. Hanson at Jet Propulsion Laboratory
1973 JUN 15, and published in the book "SOLVING LEAST SQUARES PROBLEMS",
Prentice-HalL, 1974. Revised FEB 1995 to accompany reprinting of the book
(DOI: 10.1137/1.9781611971217) by SIAM.
