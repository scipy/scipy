    """
    Minimize a function using the Constrained Optimization BY Linear
    Approximation (COBYLA) method. This method wraps a FORTRAN 
    implentation of the algorithm. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        Function to minimize. In the form func(x, \\*args).
    x0 : ndarray
        Initial guess.
    cons : sequence
        Constraint functions; must all be ``>=0`` (a single function
        if only 1 constraint). Each function takes the parameters `x`
        as its first argument.
    args : tuple
        Extra arguments to pass to function.
    consargs : tuple
        Extra arguments to pass to constraint functions (default of None means
        use same extra arguments as those passed to func).
        Use ``()`` for no extra arguments.
    rhobeg :
        Reasonable initial changes to the variables. 
    rhoend :
        Final accuracy in the optimization (not precisely guaranteed). This 
        is a lower bound on the size of the trust region.
    iprint : {0, 1, 2, 3}
        Controls the frequency of output; 0 implies no output.  Deprecated.
    disp : {0, 1, 2, 3}
        Over-rides the iprint interface.  Preferred.
    maxfun : int
        Maximum number of function evaluations.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        The argument that minimises `f`.
    
    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm is based on linear approximations to the objective 
    function and each constraint. We briefly describe the algorithm.
    
    Suppose the function is being minimized over k variables. At the 
    jth iteration the algorithm has k+1 points v_1, ..., v_(k+1),
    an approximate solution x_j, and a radius RHO_j.
    (i.e. linear plus a constant) approximations to the objective 
    function and constraint functions such that their function values
    agree with the linear approximation on the k+1 points v_1,.., v_(k+1).
    This gives a linear program to solve (where the linear approximations
    of the constraint functions are constrained to be non-negative). 
    
    However the linear approximations are likely only good 
    approximations near the current simplex, so the linear program is
    given the further requirement that the solution, which
    will become x_(j+1), must be within RHO_j from x_j. RHO_j only
    decreases, never increases. The initial RHO_j is rhobeg and the
    final RHO_j is rhoend. In this way COBYLA's iterations behave
    like a trust region algorithm.

    Additionally, the linear program may be inconsistent, or the
    approximation may give poor improvement. For details about 
    how these issues are resolved, as well as how the points v_i are 
    updated, refer to the source code or the references below.

    Examples
    --------
    Minimize the objective function f(x,y) = x*y subject
    to the constraints x**2 + y**2 < 1 and y > 0::

        >>> def objective(x):
        ...     return x[0]*x[1]
        ...
        >>> def constr1(x):
        ...     return 1 - (x[0]**2 + x[1]**2)
        ...
        >>> def constr2(x):
        ...     return x[1]
        ...
        >>> fmin_cobyla(objective, [0.0, 0.1], [constr1, constr2], rhoend=1e-7)
