    """Zero out a diagonal block of a matrix by series of Givens rotations.

    The matrix has the structure::

        [ S ]
        [ D ]

    Where S is an upper triangular matrix with shape (n, n) and D is a
    diagonal matrix with shape (n, n) with elements from `diag`. This function
    applies Givens rotations to it such that the resulting matrix has zeros
    in place of D.

    Array `S` will be modified in-place.

    Array `v` of shape (n,) is the part of the full vector with shape (2*n,)::

        [ v ]
        [ 0 ]

    to which Givens rotations are applied. This array is modified in place,
    such that on exit it contains the first n components of the above
    mentioned vector after rotations were applied.
