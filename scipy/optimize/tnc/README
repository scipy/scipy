This software is a C implementation of TNBC, a truncated newton minimization
package originally developed by Stephen G. Nash in Fortran.

The original source code can be found at :

This software aims at minimizing the value a of nonlinear function whose
variables are subject to bound constraints. It requires to be able to evaluate
the function and its gradient and is especially useful for solving large scale
problems.

This software has been rewritten from the Fortran into C and provides the
following modifications :
- reentrancy (no global variables) ;
- ability to pass a pointer to the function to be optimized (to provide
  access to constants) ;
- ability to rescale the function and variables ;
- better handling of constant (low == up) variables ;
- a simpler convergence test ;
- ability to end the minimization at any time ;
And many other small changes.

This software has been tested on a large number of platforms and should run
on any POSIX platform with an ANSI C compiler.

The last version (and other software) is avalaible at the URL :

A Python interface module is also provided.
