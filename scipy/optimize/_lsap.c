"\n"
"The linear sum assignment problem [1]_ is also known as minimum weight\n"

"C, where each C[i,j] is the cost of matching vertex i of the first partite\n"

"find a complete assignment of workers to jobs of minimal cost.\n"

"assigned to column j. Then the optimal assignment has cost\n"

"    \\min \\sum_i \\sum_j C_{i,j} X_{i,j}\n"
"\n"
"where, in the case where the matrix X is square, each row is assigned to\n"
"exactly one column, and each column to exactly one row.\n"
"\n"
"This function can also solve a generalization of the classic assignment\n"
"problem where the cost matrix is rectangular. If it has more rows than\n"
"columns, then not every row needs to be assigned to a column, and vice\n"
"versa.\n"
