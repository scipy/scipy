    Compute the Epps-Singleton (ES) test statistic.

    Test the null hypothesis that two samples have the same underlying
    probability distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array-like
        The two samples of observations to be tested. Input must not have more
        than one dimension. Samples can have different lengths.
    t : array-like, optional
        The points (t1, ..., tn) where the empirical characteristic function is
        to be evaluated. It should be positive distinct numbers. The default
        value (0.4, 0.8) is proposed in [1]_. Input must not have more than
        one dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float
        The test statistic.
    pvalue : float
        The associated p-value based on the asymptotic chi2-distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    Testing whether two samples are generated by the same underlying
    distribution is a classical question in statistics. A widely used test is
    the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test which relies on the empirical
    distribution function. Epps and Singleton introduce a test based on the
    empirical characteristic function in [1]_.

    One advantage of the ES test compared to the KS test is that is does
    not assume a continuous distribution. In [1]_, the authors conclude
    that the test also has a higher power than the KS test in many
    examples. They recommend the use of the ES test for discrete samples as
    well as continuous samples with at least 25 observations each, whereas
    `anderson_ksamp` is recommended for smaller sample sizes in the
    continuous case.

    The p-value is computed from the asymptotic distribution of the test
    statistic which follows a `chi2` distribution. If the sample size of both
    `x` and `y` is below 25, the small sample correction proposed in [1]_ is
    applied to the test statistic.

    The default values of `t` are determined in [1]_ by considering
    various distributions and finding good values that lead to a high power
    of the test in general. Table III in [1]_ gives the optimal values for
    the distributions tested in that study. The values of `t` are scaled by
    the semi-interquartile range in the implementation, see [1]_.

    Examples
    --------

    Suppose we wish to test whether data generated by ``scipy.stats.norm.rvs``
    were, in fact, drawn from the standard normal distribution. We choose a
    significance level of alpha=0.05.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> np.random.seed(626)
    >>> x = stats.norm.rvs(size=500)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(x, 'norm')
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.06342154705518796, 0.792680516270629)

    The p-value 0.79 exceeds our chosen significance level, so we do not
    reject the null hypothesis that the observed sample is drawn from the
    standard normal distribution.

    Now suppose we wish to check whether the same samples shifted by 2.1 is
    consistent with being drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 2.

    >>> y = x + 2.1
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(y, 'norm', args=(2,))
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.4798693195559657, 0.044782228803623814)

    Here we have used the `args` keyword to specify the mean (``loc``)
    of the normal distribution to test the data against. This is equivalent
    to the following, in which we create a frozen normal distribution with
    mean 2.1, then pass its ``cdf`` method as an argument.

    >>> frozen_dist = stats.norm(loc=2)
    >>> res = stats.cramervonmises(y, frozen_dist.cdf)
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.4798693195559657, 0.044782228803623814)

    In either case, we would reject the null hypothesis that the observed
    sample is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 2 (and default
    variance of 1) because the p-value 0.04 is less than our chosen
    significance level.

    Calculates Somers' D, an asymmetric measure of ordinal association

    Like Kendall's :math:`\tau`, Somers' :math:`D` is a measure of the
    correspondence between two rankings. Both statistics consider the
    difference between the number of concordant and discordant pairs in two
    rankings :math:`X` and :math:`Y`, and both are normalized such that values
    close  to 1 indicate strong agreement and values close to -1 indicate
    strong disagreement. They differ in how they are normalized. To show the
    relationship, Somers' :math:`D` can be defined in terms of Kendall's
    :math:`\tau_a`:

    .. math::
        D(Y|X) = \frac{\tau_a(X, Y)}{\tau_a(X, X)}

    Suppose the first ranking :math:`X` has :math:`r` distinct ranks and the
    second ranking :math:`Y` has :math:`s` distinct ranks. These two lists of
    :math:`n` rankings can also be viewed as an :math:`r \times s` contingency
    table in which element :math:`i, j` is the number of rank pairs with rank
    :math:`i` in ranking :math:`X` and rank :math:`j` in ranking :math:`Y`.
    Accordingly, `somersd` also allows the input data to be supplied as a
    single, 2D contingency table instead of as two separate, 1D rankings.

    Note that the definition of Somers' :math:`D` is asymmetric: in general,
    :math:`D(Y|X) \neq D(X|Y)`. ``somersd(x, y)`` calculates Somers'
    :math:`D(Y|X)`: the "row" variable :math:`X` is treated as an independent
    variable, and the "column" variable :math:`Y` is dependent. For Somers'
    :math:`D(X|Y)`, swap the input lists or transpose the input table.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: array_like
        1D array of rankings, treated as the (row) independent variable.
        Alternatively, a 2D contingency table.
    y: array_like
        If `x` is a 1D array of rankings, `y` is a 1D array of rankings of the
        same length, treated as the (column) dependent variable.
        If `x` is 2D, `y` is ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    res : SomersDResult
        A `SomersDResult` object with the following fields:

            correlation : float
               The Somers' :math:`D` statistic.

               The two-sided p-value for a hypothesis test whose null
               hypothesis is an absence of association, :math:`D=0`.
               See notes for more information.
            table : 2D array
               The contingency table formed from rankings `x` and `y` (or the
               provided contingency table, if `x` is a 2D array)

    Notes
    -----
    This function follows the contingency table approach of [2]_ and
    [3]_. *p*-values are computed based on an asymptotic approximation of
    the test statistic distribution under the null hypothesis :math:`D=0`.

    Theoretically, hypothesis tests based on Kendall's :math:`tau` and Somers'
    :math:`D` should be identical.
    However, the *p*-values returned by `kendalltau` are based
    on the null hypothesis of *independence* between :math:`X` and :math:`Y`
    (i.e. the population from which pairs in :math:`X` and :math:`Y` are
    sampled contains equal numbers of all possible pairs), which is more
    specific than the null hypothesis :math:`D=0` used here. If the null
    hypothesis of independence is desired, it is acceptable to use the
    *p*-value returned by `kendalltau` with the statistic returned by
    `somersd` and vice versa. For more information, see [2]_.

    Contingency tables are formatted according to the convention used by
    SAS and R: the first ranking supplied (``x``) is the "row" variable, and
    the second ranking supplied (``y``) is the "column" variable. This is
    opposite the convention of Somers' original paper [1]_.

    Examples
    --------
    We calculate Somers' D for the example given in [4]_, in which a hotel
    chain owner seeks to determine the association between hotel room
    cleanliness and customer satisfaction. The independent variable, hotel
    room cleanliness, is ranked on an ordinal scale: "below average (1)",
    "average (2)", or "above average (3)". The dependent variable, customer
    satisfaction, is ranked on a second scale: "very dissatisfied (1)",
    "moderately dissatisfied (2)", "neither dissatisfied nor satisfied (3)",
    "moderately satisfied (4)", or "very satisfied (5)". 189 customers
    respond to the survey, and the results are cast into a contingency table
    with the hotel room cleanliness as the "row" variable and customer
    satisfaction as the "column" variable.

    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    |     | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) |
    +=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
    | (1) | 27  | 25  | 14  | 7   | 0   |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    | (2) | 7   | 14  | 18  | 35  | 12  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
    | (3) | 1   | 3   | 2   | 7   | 17  |
    +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

    For example, 27 customers assigned their room a cleanliness ranking of
    "below average (1)" and a corresponding satisfaction of "very
    dissatisfied (1)". We perform the analysis as follows.

    >>> from scipy.stats import somersd
    >>> table = [[27, 25, 14, 7, 0], [7, 14, 18, 35, 12], [1, 3, 2, 7, 17]]
    >>> res = somersd(table)
    >>> res.statistic
    0.6032766111513396
    >>> res.pvalue
    1.0007091191074533e-27

    The value of the Somers' D statistic is approximately 0.6, indicating
    a positive correlation between room cleanliness and customer satisfaction
    in the sample.
    The *p*-value is very small, indicating a very small probability of
    observing such an extreme value of the statistic under the null
    hypothesis that the statistic of the entire population (from which
    our sample of 189 customers is drawn) is zero. This supports the
    alternative hypothesis that the true value of Somers' D for the population
    is nonzero.
