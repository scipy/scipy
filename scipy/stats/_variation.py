def variation(a, axis=0, nan_policy='propagate', ddof=0, *, keepdims=False):
    """
    Compute the coefficient of variation.

    The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the
    mean.  This function is equivalent to::

        np.std(x, axis=axis, ddof=ddof) / np.mean(x)

    The default for ``ddof`` is 0, but many definitions of the coefficient
    of variation use the square root of the unbiased sample variance
    for the sample standard deviation, which corresponds to ``ddof=1``.

    The function does not take the absolute value of the mean of the data,
    so the return value is negative if the mean is negative.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    axis : int or None, optional
        Axis along which to calculate the coefficient of variation.
        Default is 0. If None, compute over the whole array `a`.
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains ``nan``.
        The following options are available:

          * 'propagate': return ``nan``
          * 'raise': raise an exception
          * 'omit': perform the calculation with ``nan`` values omitted

        The default is 'propagate'.
    ddof : int, optional
        Gives the "Delta Degrees Of Freedom" used when computing the
        standard deviation.  The divisor used in the calculation of the
        standard deviation is ``N - ddof``, where ``N`` is the number of
        elements.  `ddof` must be less than ``N``; if it isn't, the result
        will be ``nan`` or ``inf``, depending on ``N`` and the values in
        the array.  By default `ddof` is zero for backwards compatibility,
        but it is recommended to use ``ddof=1`` to ensure that the sample
        standard deviation is computed as the square root of the unbiased
        sample variance.

    Returns
    -------
    variation : ndarray
        The calculated variation along the requested axis.

    Notes
    -----
    There are several edge cases that are handled without generating a
    warning:

    * If both the mean and the standard deviation are zero, ``nan``
      is returned.
    * If the mean is zero and the standard deviation is nonzero, ``inf``
      is returned.
    * If the input has length zero (either because the array has zero
      length, or all the input values are ``nan`` and ``nan_policy`` is
      ``'omit'``), ``nan`` is returned.
    * If the input contains ``inf``, ``nan`` is returned.
