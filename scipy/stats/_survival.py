def ecdf(sample):
    """Empirical cumulative distribution function of a sample.

    The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is a step function
    estimate of the CDF of the distribution underlying a sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : 1D array_like or `scipy.stats.CensoredData`
        Besides array_like, instances of `scipy.stats.CensoredData` containing
        uncensored and right-censored observations are supported. Currently,
        other instances of `stats.CensoredData` will result in a
        ``NotImplementedError``.

    Returns
    -------
    An object with the following attributes.

    x : ndarray
        The unique values at which the ECDF changes.
    cdf : ndarray
        The values of the ECDF corresponding with `x`.
    sf : ndarray
        The empirical survival function, the complement of the ECDF.

    Notes
    -----
    When each observation of the sample is a precise measurement, the ECDF
    steps up by ``1/len(sample)`` at each of the observations [1]_.

    When observations are lower bounds, upper bounds, or both upper and lower
    bounds, the data is said to be "censored", and `sample` may be provided as
    an instance of `scipy.stats.CensoredData`.

    For right-censored data, the ECDF is given by the Kaplan-Meier estimator
    [2]_; other forms of censoring are not supported at this time.

    Examples
    --------
    **Uncensored Data**

    As in the example from [1]_ page 79, five boys were selected at random from
    those in a single high school. Their one-mile run times were recorded as
    follows.

    >>> sample = [6.23, 5.58, 7.06, 6.42, 5.20]  # one-mile run times (minutes)

    The empirical distribution function, which approximates the distribution
    function of one-mile run times of the population from which the boys were
    sampled, is calculated as follows.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> res = stats.ecdf(sample)
    >>> res.x
    array([5.2 , 5.58, 6.23, 6.42, 7.06])
    >>> res.cdf
    array([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1. ])

    To plot the result as a step function:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> ax.step(np.insert(res.x, 0, 4), np.insert(res.cdf, 0, 0), where='post')
    >>> ax.set_xlabel('One-Mile Run Time (minutes)')
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Empirical CDF')
    >>> plt.show()

    **Right-censored Data**

    As in the example from [1]_ page 91, the lives of ten car fanbelts were
    tested. Five tests concluded because the fanbelt being tested broke, but
    the remaining tests concluded for other reasons (e.g. the study ran out of
    funding, but the fanbelt was still functional). The mileage driven
    with the fanbelts were recorded as follows.

    >>> broken = [77, 47, 81, 56, 80]  # in thousands of miles driven
    >>> unbroken = [62, 60, 43, 71, 37]

    Precise survival times of the fanbelts that were still functional at the
    end of the tests are unknown, but they are known to exceed the values
    recorded in ``unbroken``. Therefore, these observations are said to be
    "right-censored", and the data is represented using
    `scipy.stats.CensoredData`.

    >>> sample = stats.CensoredData(uncensored=broken, right=unbroken)

    The empirical survival function is calculated as follows.

    >>> res = stats.ecdf(sample)
    >>> res.x
    array([37., 43., 47., 56., 60., 62., 71., 77., 80., 81.])
    >>> res.sf
    array([1.   , 1.   , 0.875, 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.5  , 0.25 , 0.   ])

    To plot the result as a step function:

    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> ax.step(np.insert(res.x, 0, 30), np.insert(res.sf, 0, 1), where='post')
    >>> ax.set_xlabel('Fanbelt Survival Time (thousands of miles)')
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Empirical SF')
    >>> plt.show()
