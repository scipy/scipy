            log-negative-log-transformed confidence interval.

            of the sample.

        Notes
        -----
        Confidence intervals are computed according to the Greenwood formula
        (``method='linear'``) or the more recent "exponential Greenwood"
        formula (``method='log-log'``) as described in [1]_. The conventional
        Greenwood formula can result in lower confidence limits less than 0
        and upper confidence limits greater than 1; these are clipped to the
        unit interval. NaNs may be produced by either method; these are
        features of the formulas.

def ecdf(sample):
    """Empirical cumulative distribution function of a sample.

    The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) is a step function
    estimate of the CDF of the distribution underlying a sample. This function
    returns objects representing both the empirical distribution function and
    its complement, the empirical survival function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : 1D array_like or `scipy.stats.CensoredData`
        Besides array_like, instances of `scipy.stats.CensoredData` containing
        uncensored and right-censored observations are supported. Currently,
        other instances of `scipy.stats.CensoredData` will result in a
        ``NotImplementedError``.

    Returns
    -------
    res : `~scipy.stats._result_classes.ECDFResult`
        An object with the following attributes.

        x : ndarray
            The unique values in the sample.
        cdf : `~scipy.stats._result_classes.EmpiricalDistributionFunction`
            An object representing the empirical cumulative distribution function.
        sf : `~scipy.stats._result_classes.EmpiricalDistributionFunction`
            An object representing the empirical survival function.

        The `cdf` and `sf` attributes themselves have the following attributes.

        points : ndarray
            The point estimate of the CDF/SF at the values in `x`.

        And the following method:

        confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.95) :
            Compute the confidence interval around the CDF/SF at the values in
            `x`.

    Notes
    -----
    When each observation of the sample is a precise measurement, the ECDF
    steps up by ``1/len(sample)`` at each of the observations [1]_.

    When observations are lower bounds, upper bounds, or both upper and lower
    bounds, the data is said to be "censored", and `sample` may be provided as
    an instance of `scipy.stats.CensoredData`.

    For right-censored data, the ECDF is given by the Kaplan-Meier estimator
    [2]_; other forms of censoring are not supported at this time.

    Confidence intervals are computed according to the Greenwood formula or the
    more recent "Exponential Greenwood" formula as described in [4]_.

    Examples
    --------
    **Uncensored Data**

    As in the example from [1]_ page 79, five boys were selected at random from
    those in a single high school. Their one-mile run times were recorded as
    follows.

    >>> sample = [6.23, 5.58, 7.06, 6.42, 5.20]  # one-mile run times (minutes)

    The empirical distribution function, which approximates the distribution
    function of one-mile run times of the population from which the boys were
    sampled, is calculated as follows.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> res = stats.ecdf(sample)
    >>> res.x
    array([5.2 , 5.58, 6.23, 6.42, 7.06])
    >>> res.cdf.points
    array([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1. ])

    To plot the result as a step function:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> ax.step(np.insert(res.x, 0, 4), np.insert(res.cdf.points, 0, 0),
    ...         where='post')
    >>> ax.set_xlabel('One-Mile Run Time (minutes)')
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Empirical CDF')
    >>> plt.show()

    **Right-censored Data**

    As in the example from [1]_ page 91, the lives of ten car fanbelts were
    tested. Five tests concluded because the fanbelt being tested broke, but
    the remaining tests concluded for other reasons (e.g. the study ran out of
    funding, but the fanbelt was still functional). The mileage driven
    with the fanbelts were recorded as follows.

    >>> broken = [77, 47, 81, 56, 80]  # in thousands of miles driven
    >>> unbroken = [62, 60, 43, 71, 37]

    Precise survival times of the fanbelts that were still functional at the
    end of the tests are unknown, but they are known to exceed the values
    recorded in ``unbroken``. Therefore, these observations are said to be
    "right-censored", and the data is represented using
    `scipy.stats.CensoredData`.

    >>> sample = stats.CensoredData(uncensored=broken, right=unbroken)

    The empirical survival function is calculated as follows.

    >>> res = stats.ecdf(sample)
    >>> res.x
    array([37., 43., 47., 56., 60., 62., 71., 77., 80., 81.])
    >>> res.sf.points
    array([1.   , 1.   , 0.875, 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.75 , 0.5  , 0.25 , 0.   ])

    To plot the result as a step function:

    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> ax.step(np.insert(res.x, 0, 30), np.insert(res.sf.points, 0, 1),
    ...         where='post')
    >>> ax.set_xlabel('Fanbelt Survival Time (thousands of miles)')
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Empirical SF')
    >>> plt.show()
