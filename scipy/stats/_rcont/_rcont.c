/**
  This file contains two algorithms written in C to generate random two-way
  tables. The algorithms rcont1 and rcont2 originate from Boyett and Patefield,
  respectively. For more information, see the docs for each function.

  If you wonder about the spelling, rcont is short for random contingency
  table. Random contingency table is a bit of a misnomer. The tables generated
  by these algorithms have no contingency/association between the two
  variables.

  329-332. The algorithm has O(N) complexity in space and time for
  a table with N entries in total. The algorithm performs poorly for large N,

  This function uses a work space of size N which must be preallocated and

/*
  Generate random two-way table with given marginal totals.

  Patefield's algorithm adapted from AS 159 Appl. Statist. (1981) 91-97. This
  algorithm has O(K log(N)) complexity in time for a table with K cells and N
  entries in total. It requires only a small constant stack space.

  The original FORTRAN code was hand-translated to C. Changes to the original:

  - The computation of a look-up table of log-factorials was replaced with
    logfactorial function from numpy (which does something similar).
  - The original implementation allocated a column vector JWORK, but this is
    not necessary. The vector can be folded into the last column of the output
    table.
  - The function uses Numpy's random number generator and distribution library.
  - The algorithm now handles zero entries in row or column vector. When a
    zero is encountered, the output table is filled with zeros along that row
    or column and the algorithm proceeds to the next entry.

  The argument ntot is used to detect whether the function has been run before
  and has to be zero initialised.
