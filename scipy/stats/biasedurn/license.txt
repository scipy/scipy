Dear Matt The C++ code for these distributions without binding to the R project
are available here:

You have my permission to use it in SciPy under the new BSD license. 
Best regards,

Hi Agner, I'm a maintainer of the Python scientific computing library SciPy, 
and I'm working on improving the capabilities of our statistics subpackage 
scipy.stats. We'd like to add both Fisher's and Wallenius' noncentral 
hypergeometric distributions, but these look quite challenging to implement.
We found your BiasedUrn package, and we'd love to wrap it, but we can't 
include GPL-3 licensed code under our BSD-new license. Would you consider
re-licensing BiasedUrn under a more permissive license, such as BSD-new or
MIT, so we can include it in SciPy? 
Thank you for considering it!
Matt
