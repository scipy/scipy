   =REQUIRED standard distribution from UNU.RAN library
      (@pxref{Stddist,,Standard distributions}) or discrete
      distribution with inverse CDF.

   =SPEED Set-up: fast, Sampling: depends on distribution and generator

   =REINIT supported

   =DESCRIPTION
      DSTD is a wrapper for special generators for discrete univariate
      standard distributions. It only works for distributions in the 
      UNU.RAN library of standard distributions
      (@pxref{Stddist,,Standard distributions})
      or for discrete distributions where the inverse CDF is given.
      If a distribution object is provided that is build from scratch,
      it must provide the inverse CDF. Then CSTD implements the
      inversion method. Otherwise, the NULL pointer is returned.

      For some distributions more than one special generator
      is possible. 
      
   =HOWTOUSE
      Create a distribution object for a standard distribution
      from the UNU.RAN library 
      (@pxref{Stddist,,Standard distributions}),
      or create a discrete distribution object and set the function
      for the inverse CDF using unur_distr_discr_set_invcdf().
      For some distributions more than one special generator
      (@emph{variants}) is possible. These can be choosen by a
      unur_dstd_set_variant() call. For possible variants 
      @xref{Stddist,,Standard distributions}.
      However the following are common to all distributions:

      @table @code
      @item UNUR_STDGEN_DEFAULT
      the default generator.                      
      @item UNUR_STDGEN_FAST
      the fastest available special generator.
      @item UNUR_STDGEN_INVERSION
      the inversion method (if available).
      @end table
      
      Notice that the variant @code{UNUR_STDGEN_FAST} for a special
      generator might be slower than one of the universal algorithms!
      Additional variants may exist for particular distributions.

      Sampling from truncated distributions (which can be constructed by 
      changing the default domain of a distribution by means of
      unur_distr_discr_set_domain() or unur_dstd_chg_truncated calls)
      is possible but requires the inversion method. Moreover the CDF
      of the distribution must be implemented.

      It is possible to change the parameters and the domain of the chosen 
      distribution and run unur_reinit() to reinitialize the generator object.

   Using a truncated distribution is allowed only if the inversion method

   Common variants are @code{UNUR_STDGEN_DEFAULT} for the default generator,
   @code{UNUR_STDGEN_FAST} for (one of the) fastest implemented
   special generators, and @code{UNUR_STDGEN_INVERSION} for the
   inversion method (if available). 
   If the selected variant number is not implemented, then an error code is
   returned and the variant is not changed.

/*...........................................................................*/

int unur_dstd_chg_truncated( UNUR_GEN *generator, int left, int right );
/* 
   Change left and right border of the domain of the (truncated) distribution.
   This is only possible if the inversion method is used.
   Otherwise this call has no effect and an error code is returned.

   Notice that the given truncated domain must be a subset of the
   domain of the given distribution. The generator always uses the
   intersection of the domain of the distribution and the truncated
   domain given by this call.

   It is not required to run unur_reinit() after this call has been used.

   @emph{Important:} If the CDF is (almost) the same for @var{left} and 
   @var{right} and (almost) equal to @code{0} or @code{1}, then the truncated 
   domain is not chanced and the call returns an error code.

   @emph{Notice:} If the parameters of the distribution has been changed
   it is recommended to set the truncated domain again, since the
   former call might change the domain of the distribution but not
   update the values for the boundaries of the truncated
   distribution.

   to @code{UNUR_ERR_DOMAIN} and the respective bound of
   the domain of the distribution are returned (which is
   @code{INT_MIN} or @code{INT_MAX} in the case of
   unbounded domains).

   @emph{Notice}: When the domain has been truncated by a  
   unur_dstd_chg_truncated() call then the inverse CDF of the
