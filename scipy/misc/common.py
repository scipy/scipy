        Number of points for the central derivative.

    Find the n-th derivative of a function at a point.

    Given a function, use a central difference formula with spacing `dx` to
    compute the `n`-th derivative at `x0`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        Input function.
    x0 : float
        The point at which `n`-th derivative is found.
    dx : float, optional
        Spacing.
    n : int, optional
        Order of the derivative. Default is 1.

    order : int, optional
        Number of points to use, must be odd.

    Decreasing the step size too small can result in round-off error.
