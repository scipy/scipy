    '''
    Parallel pool object for parallel execution. This pool is based on
    multiprocessing.Pool augumented with the `poolsize` method to tell
    the user the number of active workers.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    n_jobs : int (Default)
        Sets the number of workers. In order to keep the responsiveness of the
        system, sometimes, this number could be set less then cpu_count().
        The default is cpu_count()
