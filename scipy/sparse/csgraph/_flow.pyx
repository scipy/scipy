    Returns

        and the flow graph in ``flow``.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError:
        if the input graph is not in CSR format.

    ValueError:
        if the capacity values are not integers, or the source or sink are out
        of bounds.

    Notes
    -----
    This solves the maximum flow problem on a given directed weighted graph:
    A flow associates to every edge a value, also called a flow, less than the
    capacity of the edge, so that for every vertex (apart from the source and
    the sink vertices), the total incoming flow is equal to the total outgoing
    flow. The value of a flow is the sum of the flow of all edges leaving the
    source vertex, and the maximum flow problem consists of finding a flow
    whose value is maximal.

    By the max-flow min-cut theorem, the maximal value of the flow is also the
    total weight of the edges in a minimum cut.

    To solve the problem, we provide Edmonds--Karp [1]_ and Dinic's algorithm
    [4]_. The implementation of both algorithms strive to exploit sparsity.
    The time complexity of the former :math:`O(|V|\,|E|^2)` and its space
    complexity is :math:`O(|E|)`. The latter achieves its performance by
    building level graphs and finding blocking flows in them. Its time
    complexity is :math:`O(|V|^2\,|E|)` and its space complexity is
    :math:`O(|E|)`.

    The maximum flow problem is usually defined with real valued capacities,
    but we require that all capacities are integral to ensure convergence. When
    dealing with rational capacities, or capacities belonging to
    :math:`x\mathbb{Q}` for some fixed :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}`, it is possible
    to reduce the problem to the integral case by scaling all capacities
    accordingly.

    Solving a maximum-flow problem can be used for example for graph cuts
    optimization in computer vision [3]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Perhaps the simplest flow problem is that of a graph of only two vertices
    with an edge from source (0) to sink (1)::

        (0) --5--> (1)

    Here, the maximum flow is simply the capacity of the edge:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
    >>> from scipy.sparse.csgraph import maximum_flow
    >>> graph = csr_matrix([[0, 5], [0, 0]])
    >>> maximum_flow(graph, 0, 1).flow_value
    5
    >>> maximum_flow(graph, 0, 1, method='edmonds_karp').flow_value
    5

    If, on the other hand, there is a bottleneck between source and sink, that
    can reduce the maximum flow::

        (0) --5--> (1) --3--> (2)

    >>> graph = csr_matrix([[0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0]])
    >>> maximum_flow(graph, 0, 2).flow_value
    3

    A less trivial example is given in [2]_, Chapter 26.1:

    >>> graph = csr_matrix([[0, 16, 13,  0,  0,  0],
    ...                     [0,  0, 10, 12,  0,  0],
    ...                     [0,  4,  0,  0, 14,  0],
    ...                     [0,  0,  9,  0,  0, 20],
    ...                     [0,  0,  0,  7,  0,  4],
    ...                     [0,  0,  0,  0,  0,  0]])
    >>> maximum_flow(graph, 0, 5).flow_value
    23

    It is possible to reduce the problem of finding a maximum matching in a
    bipartite graph to a maximum flow problem: Let :math:`G = ((U, V), E)` be a
    bipartite graph. Then, add to the graph a source vertex with edges to every
    vertex in :math:`U` and a sink vertex with edges from every vertex in
    :math:`V`. Finally, give every edge in the resulting graph a capacity of 1.
    Then, a maximum flow in the new graph gives a maximum matching in the
    original graph consisting of the edges in :math:`E` whose flow is positive.

    Assume that the edges are represented by a
    :math:`\lvert U \rvert \times \lvert V \rvert` matrix in CSR format whose
    :math:`(i, j)`'th entry is 1 if there is an edge from :math:`i \in U` to
    :math:`j \in V` and 0 otherwise; that is, the input is of the form required
    by :func:`maximum_bipartite_matching`. Then the CSR representation of the
    graph constructed above contains this matrix as a block. Here's an example:

    >>> graph = csr_matrix([[0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0]])
    >>> print(graph.toarray())
    [[0 1 0 1]
     [1 0 1 0]
     [0 1 1 0]]
    >>> i, j = graph.shape
    >>> n = graph.nnz
    >>> indptr = np.concatenate([[0],
    ...                          graph.indptr + i,
    ...                          np.arange(n + i + 1, n + i + j + 1),
    ...                          [n + i + j]])
    >>> indices = np.concatenate([np.arange(1, i + 1),
    ...                           graph.indices + i + 1,
    ...                           np.repeat(i + j + 1, j)])
    >>> data = np.ones(n + i + j, dtype=int)
    >>>
    >>> graph_flow = csr_matrix((data, indices, indptr))
    >>> print(graph_flow.toarray())
    [[0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0]
     [0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]

    At this point, we can find the maximum flow between the added sink and the
    added source and the desired matching can be obtained by restricting the
    flow function to the block corresponding to the original graph:

    >>> result = maximum_flow(graph_flow, 0, i+j+1, method='dinic')
    >>> matching = result.flow[1:i+1, i+1:i+j+1]
    >>> print(matching.toarray())
    [[0 1 0 0]
     [1 0 0 0]
     [0 0 1 0]]

    This tells us that the first, second, and third vertex in :math:`U` are
    matched with the second, first, and third vertex in :math:`V` respectively.

    While this solves the maximum bipartite matching problem in general, note
    that algorithms specialized to that problem, such as
    :func:`maximum_bipartite_matching`, will generally perform better.

    This approach can also be used to solve various common generalizations of
    the maximum bipartite matching problem. If, for instance, some vertices can
    be matched with more than one other vertex, this may be handled by
    modifying the capacities of the new graph appropriately.

    minimum_cost_flow(csgraph, demand, cost)

    Finds a flow which minimizes the total cost while satisfying all
    vertices' demands in the given directed graph.

    .. versionadded:: 1.9.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    csgraph : csr_matrix
        The square matrix representing a directed graph whose (i, j)'th entry
        is an integer representing the capacity of the edge between
        vertices i and j.
    demand : array_like
        One dimensional array whose v'th entry is an integer representing the demand
        of vertex v.
    cost : array_like
        One dimensional array whose e'th entry is an integer representing the cost
        of per unit flow passing through edge e.

    Returns
    -------
    res : MinimumCostFlowResult
        A minimum cost flow represented by a ``MinimumCostFlowResult``
        which includes the cost of the flow in ``flow_cost`` and
        the flow graph in ``flow``.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError:
        if the input graph is not in CSR format.

    ValueError:
        If any of the following conditions is met:
          - the capacity values, vertex demands or edge costs are not integers
          - an edge cost or vertex demand are infinite in absolute value
          - an edge has negative capacity
          - the sum of demands is not zero
          - there doesn't exist a flow which satisfies all vertex demands.

    Notes
    -----
    This solves the minimum cost flow problem [1]_ on a given directed weighted graph:
    a flow associates to every edge a value, also called a flow, less than the
    capacity of the edge, and for provided cost of the edge so that for every
    vertex (apart from the source and the sink vertices), the difference between
    the total incoming flow and the total outgoing flow is equal to the demand
    of that vertex. The value of a flow is the sum of the flow on all edges and
    the minimum cost flow problem consists of finding a flow whose cost (which is
    defined as the scalar product of the edges' flows and costs) is minimal.

    To solve the problem, we use Network Simplex [2]_.
    The time complexity of the former :math:`O(|V|^2\,|E|\,log(|V|\,C))`.

    The minimum cost flow problem is usually defined with real valued capacities,
    edge costs and vertex demands but we require that all capacities are integral.
    When dealing with rational capacities, or capacities belonging to
    :math:`x\mathbb{Q}` for some fixed :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}`, it is possible
    to reduce the problem to the integral case by scaling all capacities
    accordingly.

    Solving a minimum cost flow problem has many practical uses such as
    in assignment problem, covers and matching in bipartite graphs [3]_.

    We have ported the Python implementation of NetworkX [4]_ to Cython.
