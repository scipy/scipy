The following changes have been made to the original SuperLU 4.0 sources:

1) ENH: scipy.sparse.dsolve/SuperLU: re-apply r4767, r4768, r5892 patches to SuperLU sources
    
    - Rename c_abs() and c_abs1() to slu_c_abs() and slu_c_abs1() to
      avoid conflict with Python headers. Hopefully resolves ticket #735
    
    - BUG: fix SuperLU dubious format string.

    - Drop ?myblas2.c routines, since we USE_VENDOR_BLAS

    - Do not include *.f Harwell Subroutine Library files because of
      license issues.

2) ENH: sparse.linalg.dsolve/SuperLU: patch SuperLU upstream sources to get some variables from Scipy

3) BUG: scipy.sparse.dsolve/SuperLU: sprinkle volatile into dlamc/slamc implementation to avoid an infinite loop

4) BUG: sparse.linalg.dsolve/SuperLU: patch SuperLU sources to eliminate a crash for singular matrices for which pivoting fails
