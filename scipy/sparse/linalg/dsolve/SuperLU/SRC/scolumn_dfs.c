/*! \brief
 *
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *   SCOLUMN_DFS performs a symbolic factorization on column jcol, and
 *   decide the supernode boundary.
 *
 *   This routine does not use numeric values, but only use the RHS 
 *   row indices to start the dfs.
 *
 *   A supernode representative is the last column of a supernode.
 *   The nonzeros in U[*,j] are segments that end at supernodal
 *   representatives. The routine returns a list of such supernodal 
 *   representatives in topological order of the dfs that generates them.
 *   The location of the first nonzero in each such supernodal segment
 *   (supernodal entry location) is also returned.
 *
 * Local parameters
 * ================
 *   nseg: no of segments in current U[*,j]
 *   jsuper: jsuper=EMPTY if column j does not belong to the same
 *	supernode as j-1. Otherwise, jsuper=nsuper.
 *
 *   marker2: A-row --> A-row/col (0/1)
 *   repfnz: SuperA-col --> PA-row
 *   parent: SuperA-col --> SuperA-col
 *   xplore: SuperA-col --> index to L-structure
 *
 * Return value
 * ============
 *     0  success;
 *   > 0  number of bytes allocated when run out of space.
 * </pre>
