This directory contains a bundled version of ARPACK-NG 3.1.2,
http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arpack-ng/

NOTE FOR VENDORS: it is in general safe to use a system version of ARPACK
instead. Note, however, that earlier versions of ARPACK and ARPACK-NG had
certain bugs, so using those over the bundled version is not recommended.

The bundled version has the following patch applied:

Replace calls to certain Fortran functions with wrapper
functions, to avoid various ABI mismatches on OSX. These changes are
made with the following command:
