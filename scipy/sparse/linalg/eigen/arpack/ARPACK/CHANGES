arpack-ng - 3.1.4

 * libparpack2: missing dependency on MPI:
   https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=718790

 * Replace LAPACK second function with ARPACK's own arscnd in PARPACK

 * Fix issue #1259 in DSEUPD and SSEUPD
   The Ritz vector purification step assumes workl(iq) still contains the
   original Q matrix. This is however overwritten by the call to xGEQR2
   earlier.
   .
   This patch fixes the issue by making a copy of the last row of the
   eigenvector matrix, after it is recomputed after QR by xORM2R. The work
   space WORKL(IW+NCV:IW+2*NCV) is not used later in the routine, and can
   be used for this.

 * Use configure supplied blas and lapack in the pkg-config.
   Thanks to Ward Poelmans (Closes: #1320)

 * Switch to automake 1.14 + libtool 2.4.2.
   Thanks to Ward Poelmans (Closes: #1321)

 * dseupd routine may lead to a segmentation fault
   Thanks to Edouard Canot (Closes: #1323)

 * dsaupd and 'BE' option returns wrong eigenvalues for a SPD matrix
   Thanks to Edouard Canot (Closes: #1329)

     (Closes: #784)
   * Fixed division by zero in smlnum by usind p[d,s]lamch instead of the
     serial. Thanks to Umberto De Giovannini.

arpack-ng - 3.1.0

   * Many bug fixes in the parpack lib. It is an old patch from upstream.
     Thanks to Viral Shah for pinging us on this subject.
     See the PARPACK_CHANGES file for the details.
   * Change the bug report from arpack@caam.rice.edu to
     http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arpack-ng/issues/
   * Provide a M4 macro (detect_arpack_bug.m4) to check if the underlying
     arpack is buggy (ie not arpack-ng). This allows developper applications
     to perform the check in their autotools build system (configure).
   * Fixed a lack of appropriate bounds check in DNAUP2. Thanks to Pauli Virtanen
     for the patch (Closes: #632)
   * Update of the doc about TOL in dnaupd.
   * Reorder bug fixed when eigenvectors are requested and the resulting
     number of converged eigenvalues is less than the number requested.
     Patches from Tim Mitchell. (Closes: #664)
   * TESTS/ directory added and built.

arpack-ng - 3.0

   * Patches from Scilab
     second_NONE used by default (TO DO replace by second in LAPACK)
     second_NONE works with all fortrans compilers (used by default with Scilab)

     sneupd.f, cneupd.f: modified for scilab add a check on nconv value (Scilab bug fix)
     dnaupd.f: modified  NEV Integer: INPUT/OUTPUT before only INPUT (Scilab bug fix)

   * Patches from Octave: (Thanks to John W. EATON)
     dneupd.f: Restore value of nconv
     dseupd.f: Restore value of nconv
     sseupd.f: Change GOTO target to eliminate warning about landing on end if.
     zneupd.f: Restore value of nconv

   * Compilation
     Apply gentoo patches to use an autotools build system
     Build system updated to build with Visual Studio 2010 + Intel fortran 2011 compiles on Windows.
     Specify the SONAME to libarpack.so.2 (no API/ABI changes compare to version 2.0)
