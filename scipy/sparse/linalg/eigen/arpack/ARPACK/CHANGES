arpack-ng - 3.7.0

[ Franck Houssen ]
 * [BUG FIX] ICB: missing workev for *[ds]neupd (real+not-sym) => API/ABI change for *[ds]neupd_c.
 * [BUG FIX] autotools - make distcheck: fix circular dependencies.
 * arpackmm: utility to test arpack with matrix market files.
 * ICB: add ILP64 support.
    The idea is:
    - cmake      generates arpackdef.h from arpackdef.cmake.h.in
    - autoheader generates arpackdef.h from arpackdef.autotools.h[.in]
    - arpack includes arpackdef.h when/where needed:
      - #define provide c_int/a_int according to architecture.
      - all f90 who need to include "arpackdef.h" must be moved to F90.
        Note: by convention, F90 are preprocessed (f90 are not).
    - MPI does not support ILP64: integer*4 must be imposed in all
      calls involving MPI (f90 example/test code).
    To enable ILP64 users to compile/link, arpackdef.h is added in
    the arpack installation (make install).

 [ Kyle Guinn ]
 * Autoconf/Automake simplifications and fixes.
 * Simplify the generation of arpackdef.h.

arpack-ng - 3.1.4

 * libparpack2: missing dependency on MPI:
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=718790

 * Replace LAPACK second function with ARPACK's own arscnd in PARPACK

 * Fix issue #1259 in DSEUPD and SSEUPD
   The Ritz vector purification step assumes workl(iq) still contains the
   original Q matrix. This is however overwritten by the call to xGEQR2
   earlier.
   .
   This patch fixes the issue by making a copy of the last row of the
   eigenvector matrix, after it is recomputed after QR by xORM2R. The work
   space WORKL(IW+NCV:IW+2*NCV) is not used later in the routine, and can
   be used for this.

 * Use configure supplied blas and lapack in the pkg-config.
   Thanks to Ward Poelmans (Closes: #1320)

 * Switch to automake 1.14 + libtool 2.4.2.
   Thanks to Ward Poelmans (Closes: #1321)

 * dseupd routine may lead to a segmentation fault
   Thanks to Edouard Canot (Closes: #1323)

 * dsaupd and 'BE' option returns wrong eigenvalues for a SPD matrix
   Thanks to Edouard Canot (Closes: #1329)

arpack-ng - 3.1.0

   * Many bug fixes in the parpack lib. It is an old patch from upstream.
     Thanks to Viral Shah for pinging us on this subject.
     See the PARPACK_CHANGES file for the details.
