arpack-ng - 3.1.0

   * Many bug fixes in the parpack lib. It is an old patch from upstream.
     Thanks to Viral Shah for pinging us on this subject.
     See the PARPACK_CHANGES file for the details.
   * Change the bug report from arpack@caam.rice.edu to 
     http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arpack-ng/issues/
   * Provide a M4 macro (detect_arpack_bug.m4) to check if the underlying
     arpack is buggy (ie not arpack-ng). This allows developper applications
     to perform the check in their autotools build system (configure).
   * Fixed a lack of appropriate bounds check in DNAUP2. Thanks to Pauli Virtanen
     for the patch (Closes: #632)
   * Update of the doc about TOL in dnaupd.
   * Reorder bug fixed when eigenvectors are requested and the resulting
     number of converged eigenvalues is less than the number requested.
     Patches from Tim Mitchell. (Closes: #664)
   * TESTS/ directory added and built.

   * Update the title & version in the configure.ac
   * Always search for MPILIBS (in order to have the variable correctly set)
   * Explicitly link against MPI fortran libs for parpack

arpack-ng - 3.0

   * Patches from Scilab
     second_NONE used by default (TO DO replace by second in LAPACK)
     second_NONE works with all fortrans compilers (used by default with Scilab)

     sneupd.f, cneupd.f: modified for scilab add a check on nconv value (Scilab bug fix)
     dnaupd.f: modified  NEV Integer: INPUT/OUTPUT before only INPUT (Scilab bug fix) 
 
   * Patches from Octave: (Thanks to John W. EATON)
     dneupd.f: Restore value of nconv
     dseupd.f: Restore value of nconv
     sseupd.f: Change GOTO target to eliminate warning about landing on end if.
     zneupd.f: Restore value of nconv

   * Compilation
     Apply gentoo patches to use an autotools build system
     Build system updated to build with Visual Studio 2010 + Intel fortran 2011 compiles on Windows.
     Specify the SONAME to libarpack.so.2 (no API/ABI changes compare to version 2.0)
