PROPACK in C
============

This project is a C adaptation and rewrite of the well-known Fortran77 PROPACK library
which is designed to efficiently compute the singular values and singular vectors of a
large, sparse and/or structured matrix.

PROPACK is written by Rasmus Munk Larsen and the original code, at the time of writing,
lives in

    https://github.com/rmlarsen/propack

Original Fortran77 PROPACK license can be found in the "PROPACK_LICENSE.txt" file
and also at the original code location. The rewrite license is derived from SciPy
project license BSD-3, and provided here again, for convenience in the LICENSE file
for external use.

While the original intention is to be used within the SciPy project, the C code here is
also kept as a separate C library without any SciPy specifics such that the code can be
extracted to other projects.

The major differences between the original PROPACK and this rewrite are;

 - the removal of all SAVE'd Fortran77 variables
 - some changes in the main function signatures
 - the randomization is changed to xoshiro256+ and seeds are externalized to the user
 - many routines are cleaned up from antiquated GOTO-based flows
