/*! \brief
 *
 * <pre>
 * Purpose
 * =======
 *
 *   ZLDPERM finds a row permutation so that the matrix has large
 *   entries on the diagonal.
 *
 * Arguments
 * =========
 *
 * job    (input) int
 *        Control the action. Possible values for JOB are:
 *        = 1 : Compute a row permutation of the matrix so that the
 *              permuted matrix has as many entries on its diagonal as
 *              possible. The values on the diagonal are of arbitrary size.
 *              HSL subroutine MC21A/AD is used for this.
 *        = 2 : Compute a row permutation of the matrix so that the smallest 
 *              value on the diagonal of the permuted matrix is maximized.
 *        = 3 : Compute a row permutation of the matrix so that the smallest
 *              value on the diagonal of the permuted matrix is maximized.
 *              The algorithm differs from the one used for JOB = 2 and may
 *              have quite a different performance.
 *        = 4 : Compute a row permutation of the matrix so that the sum
 *              of the diagonal entries of the permuted matrix is maximized.
 *        = 5 : Compute a row permutation of the matrix so that the product
 *              of the diagonal entries of the permuted matrix is maximized
 *              and vectors to scale the matrix so that the nonzero diagonal 
 *              entries of the permuted matrix are one in absolute value and 
 *              all the off-diagonal entries are less than or equal to one in 
 *              absolute value.
 *        Restriction: 1 <= JOB <= 5.
 *
 * n      (input) int
 *        The order of the matrix.
 *
 * nnz    (input) int
 *        The number of nonzeros in the matrix.
 *
 * adjncy (input) int*, of size nnz
 *        The adjacency structure of the matrix, which contains the row
 *        indices of the nonzeros.
 *
 * colptr (input) int*, of size n+1
 *        The pointers to the beginning of each column in ADJNCY.
 *
 * nzval  (input) doublecomplex*, of size nnz
 *        The nonzero values of the matrix. nzval[k] is the value of
 *        the entry corresponding to adjncy[k].
 *        It is not used if job = 1.
 *
 * perm   (output) int*, of size n
 *        The permutation vector. perm[i] = j means row i in the
 *        original matrix is in row j of the permuted matrix.
 *
 * u      (output) double*, of size n
 *        If job = 5, the natural logarithms of the row scaling factors. 
 *
 * v      (output) double*, of size n
 *        If job = 5, the natural logarithms of the column scaling factors. 
 *        The scaled matrix B has entries b_ij = a_ij * exp(u_i + v_j).
 * </pre>

    /* 
     * NOTE:
     * =====
     *
     * MC64AD assumes that column permutation vector is defined as:
     * perm(i) = j means column i of permuted A is in column j of original A.
     *
     * Since a symmetric permutation preserves the diagonal entries. Then
     * by the following relation:
     *     P'(A*P')P = P'A
     * we can apply inverse(perm) to rows of A to get large diagonal entries.
     * But, since 'perm' defined in MC64AD happens to be the reverse of
     * SuperLU's definition of permutation vector, therefore, it is already
     * an inverse for our purpose. We will thus use it directly.
