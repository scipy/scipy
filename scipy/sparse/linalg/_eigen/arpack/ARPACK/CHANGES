arpack-ng - 3.9.1

[ Fabien Péan ]
 * pyarpack: Ensure that the matrix properties (symmetric/hermitian) fit the solver (CG/LDL) with which they are used in the tests
 * [BUG FIX] Tests for PARPACK with C/C++ bindings icb_parpack_c and icb_parpack_cpp are now really parallel and split the problem across MPI processes.

[ Szabolcs Horvát ]
 * [BUG FIX] Ensure that LAPACK RNG state is propagated (regression in 3.9.0).
 * [BUG FIX] Ensure that separate random seeds are used on different parallel thread in D and S versions of functions (issue from original ARPACK).

[ Ruoyu Feng ]
 * ICB(arpackdef.h): distinct intel llvm compiler (icx with clang-cl) from msvc on windows
 * ICB(arpackdef.h): Undef macro I if complex.h from msvc version is loaded, which is an usual name and causes issues on arpackSolver.

[ Franck Houssen ]
 * [BUG FIX] Fix install: headers in /path/to/local/include/arpack for ICB samples
 * [BUG FIX] Fix install: headers in /path/to/local/include/arpack

 * Test autotools pkg-config (*.pc files) with/without LIBSUFFIX/ITF64SUFFIX.
 * Test CMake find_package (*.cmake files) with/without LIBSUFFIX/ITF64SUFFIX.
 * [BUG FIX] autotools: ICB must be checked first (MPI changes compilers).

[ Juan José García-Ripoll ]
 * Adapt the C/C++ interface to accept also MSVC's non-standard complex types.
 * Propagate dependencies to CMake targets that use arpack-ng:
   - Create CMake-generated targets and configuration files that keep track of
     arpack's dependencies (libraries, directories) and expose them to users.
   - Install those files under ${prefix}/lib/cmake/arpackng* so that arpack can be
     found using 'find_package(arpackng)' from CMake files.
   - Add code to the arpackng-config.cmake to find required dependencies when this
     module is loaded by find_package(arpackng).

 * CI: Support for centos added in automation.
 * CI: Support for opensuse added in automation.
 * arpackSolver/arpackmm: switch eigen version to 3.3.

arpack-ng - 3.7.0

[ Franck Houssen ]
 * [BUG FIX] ICB: missing workev for *[ds]neupd (real+not-sym) => API/ABI change for *[ds]neupd_c.
 * [BUG FIX] autotools - make distcheck: fix circular dependencies.
 * arpackmm: utility to test arpack with matrix market files.
 * ICB: add ILP64 support.
    The idea is:
    - autoheader/cmake generates arpackdef.h/arpackicb.h from arpackdef.h.in/arpackicb.h.in
      - in C/C++ files: arpackdef.h defines a_int according to architecture.
      - in F77/F90 files: arpackicb.h defines i_int to architecture.
    - MPI does not support ILP64: integer*4 must be imposed in all
      calls involving MPI (f90 example/test code).
    To enable ILP64 users to compile/link, arpackdef.h/arpackicb.h is added in
    the arpack installation (make install).

 [ Kyle Guinn ]
 * Autoconf/Automake simplifications and fixes.
 * Simplify the generation of arpackdef.h.

arpack-ng - 3.4.0

  [ Milan Bouchet-Valat ]

arpack-ng - 3.1.4

 * libparpack2: missing dependency on MPI:
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=718790

 * Replace LAPACK second function with ARPACK's own arscnd in PARPACK

 * Fix issue #1259 in DSEUPD and SSEUPD
   The Ritz vector purification step assumes workl(iq) still contains the
   original Q matrix. This is however overwritten by the call to xGEQR2
   earlier.
   .
   This patch fixes the issue by making a copy of the last row of the
   eigenvector matrix, after it is recomputed after QR by xORM2R. The work
   space WORKL(IW+NCV:IW+2*NCV) is not used later in the routine, and can
   be used for this.

 * Use configure supplied blas and lapack in the pkg-config.
   Thanks to Ward Poelmans (Closes: #1320)

 * Switch to automake 1.14 + libtool 2.4.2.
