Library directories
-------------------
znzlib   -- low level library for handling read/write of compressed files.

niftilib -- core i/o routines for reading and writing nifti-1 format files.
	    Primarily routines to read/write and manipulate the header field
	    information, including orientation matrices.  Volume-wise,
            timecourse-wise, access to image data.  

nifticdf -- functions to compute cumulative distributions and their inverses

fsliolib -- i/o routines for reading and writing nifti-1 format files, higher
            level than niftilib, includes routines for reading the data blob by
            volume, timecourse, etc., and, addresses image orientation issues.
            *** work in progress, subject to significant revision.....

utils    -- directory containing library utility programs (nifti_tool)

examples  -- directory containing sample code using nifti reference library
real_easy -- code snippets to read nifti-1 files, not using nifti ref. lib.
Testing   -- directory containing code to test the libraries


Instructions to build
