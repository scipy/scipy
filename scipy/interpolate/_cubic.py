class PchipInterpolator(BPoly):
    r"""PCHIP 1-d monotonic cubic interpolation.

    `x` and `y` are arrays of values used to approximate some function f,
    with ``y = f(x)``. The interpolant uses monotonic cubic splines
    to find the value of new points. (PCHIP stands for Piecewise Cubic
    Hermite Interpolating Polynomial).

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray
        A 1-D array of monotonically increasing real values.  `x` cannot
        include duplicate values (otherwise f is overspecified)
    y : ndarray
        A 1-D array of real values. `y`'s length along the interpolation
        axis must be equal to the length of `x`. If N-D array, use `axis`
        parameter to select correct axis.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis in the y array corresponding to the x-coordinate values.
    extrapolate : bool, optional
        Whether to extrapolate to out-of-bounds points based on first
        and last intervals, or to return NaNs.

    Methods

    __call__
    derivative
    antiderivative

    Notes
    -----
    The interpolator preserves monotonicity in the interpolation data and does
    not overshoot if the data is not smooth.

    The first derivatives are guaranteed to be continuous, but the second
    derivatives may jump at :math:`x_k`.

    Determines the derivatives at the points :math:`x_k`, :math:`f'_k`,
    by using PCHIP algorithm [1]_.

    Let :math:`h_k = x_{k+1} - x_k`, and  :math:`d_k = (y_{k+1} - y_k) / h_k`
    are the slopes at internal points :math:`x_k`.
    If the signs of :math:`d_k` and :math:`d_{k-1}` are different or either of
    them equals zero, then :math:`f'_k = 0`. Otherwise, it is given by the
    weighted harmonic mean

    .. math::

        \frac{w_1 + w_2}{f'_k} = \frac{w_1}{d_{k-1}} + \frac{w_2}{d_k}

    where :math:`w_1 = 2 h_k + h_{k-1}` and :math:`w_2 = h_k + 2 h_{k-1}`.

    The end slopes are set using a one-sided scheme [2]_.

    """Cubic spline data interpolator.

    Interpolate data with a piecewise cubic polynomial which is twice
    continuously differentiable [1]_. The result is represented as a `PPoly`
    instance with breakpoints matching the given data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (n,)
        1-d array containing values of the independent variable.
        Values must be real, finite and in strictly increasing order.
    y : array_like
        Array containing values of the dependent variable. It can have
        arbitrary number of dimensions, but the length along `axis` (see below)
        must match the length of `x`. Values must be finite.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which `y` is assumed to be varying. Meaning that for
        ``x[i]`` the corresponding values are ``np.take(y, i, axis=axis)``.
        Default is 0.
    extrapolate : bool, optional
        Whether to extrapolate to out-of-bounds points based on first and last
        intervals, or to return NaNs. Default is True.

    Attributes
    ----------
    x : ndarray, shape (n,)
        Breakpoints. The same `x` which was passed to the constructor.
    c : ndarray, shape (4, n-1, ...)
        Coefficients of the polynomials on each segment. The trailing
        dimensions match the dimensions of `y`, excluding `axis`. For example,
        if `y` is 1-d, then ``c[k, i]`` is a coefficient for
        ``(x-x[i])**(3-k)`` on the segment between ``x[i]`` and ``x[i+1]``.
    axis : int
        Interpolation axis. The same `axis` which was passed to the
        constructor.

    derivative
    antiderivative

    roots

    Notes
    -----
    Two additional equations are required to determine all coefficients
    of polynomials on each segment. They are formed from the conditions that
    at the first and the last interior knots the third derivative is
    continuous. It essentially means that the first and the second segments
    (on both ends) are described by the same cubic polynomial. These conditions
    are called "not-a-knot" and are known to give better interpolation accuracy
    when nothing is known about end point derivatives [2]_.

    When n=2 or n=3, the solution is sought as a linear/quadratic function
    passing through the given points.

    `InterpolatedUnivariateSpline` and `splrep` (with ``s=0``) construct an
    equivalent interpolation curve in the B-spline basis.

    .. versionadded:: 0.18.0

    Examples
    --------
    In this example the cubic spline is used to interpolate a sampled sinusoid.
    You can see that the spline continuity property holds for the first and
    second derivatives and violates only for the third derivative.
