    """Generate knot vectors until the Least SQuares (LSQ) criterion is satified.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        The data points defining the curve ``y = f(x)``.
    w : array_like, optional
        Weights.
    xb : float, optional
        The boundary of the approximation interval. If None (default),
        is set to ``x[0]``.
    xe : float, optional
        The boundary of the approximation interval. If None (default),
        is set to ``x[-1]``.
    k : int, optional
        The spline degree. Default is cubic, ``k = 3``.
    s : float, optional
        The smoothing factor. Default is ``s = 0``.
    nest : int, optional
        Stop when at least this many knots are placed.
          ends are equivalent.
    bc_type : str, optional
        Boundary conditions.
        Default is `"not-a-knot"`.
        The following boundary conditions are recognized:

        * ``"not-a-knot"`` (default): The first and second segments are the
          same polynomial. This is equivalent to having ``bc_type=None``.
        * ``"periodic"``: The values and the first ``k-1`` derivatives at the
          ends are equivalent.

    Yields
    ------
    t : ndarray
        Knot vectors with an increasing number of knots.
        The generator is finite: it stops when the smoothing critetion is
        satisfied, or when then number of knots exceeds the maximum value:
        the user-provided `nest` or `x.size + k + 1` --- which is the knot vector
        for the interpolating spline.

    Examples
    --------
    Generate some noisy data and fit a sequence of LSQ splines:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from scipy.interpolate import make_lsq_spline, generate_knots
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
    >>> x = np.linspace(-3, 3, 50)
    >>> y = np.exp(-x**2) + 0.1 * rng.standard_normal(size=50)

    >>> knots = list(generate_knots(x, y, s=1e-10))
    >>> for t in knots[::3]:
    ...     spl = make_lsq_spline(x, y, t)
    ...     xs = xs = np.linspace(-3, 3, 201)
    ...     plt.plot(xs, spl(xs), '-', label=f'n = {len(t)}', lw=3, alpha=0.7)
    >>> plt.plot(x, y, 'o', label='data')
    >>> plt.plot(xs, np.exp(-xs**2), '--')
    >>> plt.legend()

    Note that increasing the number of knots make the result follow the data
    more and more closely.

    Also note that a step of the generator may add multiple knots:

    >>> [len(t) for t in knots]
    [8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 24, 40, 48, 52, 54]

    Notes
    -----
    The routine generates successive knots vectors of increasing length, starting
    from ``2*(k+1)`` to ``len(x) + k + 1``, trying to make knots more dense
    in the regions where the deviation of the LSQ spline from data is large.

    When the maximum number of knots, ``len(x) + k + 1`` is reached
    (this happens when ``s`` is small and ``nest`` is large), the generator
    stops, and the last output is the knots for the interpolation with the
    not-a-knot boundary condition.

    Knots are located at data sites, unless ``k`` is even and the number of knots
    is ``len(x) + k + 1``. In that case, the last output of the generator
    has internal knots at Greville sites, ``(x[1:] + x[:-1]) / 2``.

    Given scalar `p`, we solve the system of equations in the LSQ sense:

        | A     |  @ | c | = | y |
        | B / p |    | 0 |   | 0 |

    where `A` is the matrix of b-splines and `b` is the discontinuity matrix
    (the jumps of the k-th derivatives of b-spline basis elements at knots).

    Since we do that repeatedly while minimizing over `p`, we QR-factorize
    `A` only once and update the QR factorization only of the `B` rows of the
    augmented matrix |A, B/p|.

    The system of equations is Eq. (15) Ref. [1]_, the strategy and implementation
    follows that of FITPACK, see specific links below.

class Fperiodic:
    """
    Fit a smooth periodic B-spline curve to given data points.

    This class fits a periodic B-spline curve S(t) of degree k through data points
    (x, y) with knots t. The spline is smooth and repeats itself at the start and
    end, meaning the function and its derivatives up to order k-1 are equal
    at the boundaries.

    We want to find spline coefficients c that minimize the difference between
    the spline and the data, while also keeping the spline smooth. This is done
    by solving:

        minimize || W^{1/2} (Y - B c) ||^2 + s * c^T @ R @ c
        subject to periodic constraints on c.

    where:
      - Y is the data values,
      - B is the matrix of B-spline basis functions at points x,
      - W is a weighting matrix for the data points,
      - s is the smoothing parameter (larger s means smoother curve),
      - R is a matrix that penalizes wiggliness of the spline,
      - c spline coefficients to be solved for
      - periodic constraints ensure the spline repeats smoothly.

    The solution is obtained by forming augmented matrices and performing
    a QR factorization that incorporates these constraints, following the
    approach in FITPACK's `fpperi.f`.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    x : array_like, shape (n,)
    y : array_like, shape (n, m)
    t : array_like, shape (nt,)
        Knot vector for the spline
    k : int
        Degree of the spline.
    s : float
        Controls smoothness: bigger s means smoother curve, smaller s fits data closer.
    w : array_like, shape (n,), optional
        Weights for data points. Defaults to all ones.
    R, Y, A1, A2, Z : arrays, optional
        Precomputed matrices from least squares and QR factorization steps to speed up
        repeated fits with the same knots and data.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    G1, G2 : arrays
        Augmented matrices combining the original QR factors and constraints related to
        the spline basis and data. G1 is roughly the "upper-triangular" part;
        G2 contains additional constraint information for periodicity.

    H1, H2 : arrays
        Matrices associated with the discontinuity jump constraints of the k-th
        derivative of B-splines at the knots. These encode the periodicity
        conditions and are scaled by the smoothing parameter.

    offset : array
        Offset indices used for efficient indexing during QR reduction.

    Methods:
    --------
    __call__(p):
        Perform QR reduction of augmented matrices scaled by 1/p, solve for spline
        coefficients, and return residual difference fp - s.

    r"""Create a smoothing B-spline function with bounded error, minimizing derivative jumps.

    Given the set of data points ``(x[i], y[i])``, determine a smooth spline
    approximation of degree ``k`` on the interval ``xb <= x <= xe``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, shape (m,)
        The data points defining a curve ``y = f(x)``.
    w : array_like, shape (m,), optional
        Strictly positive 1D array of weights, of the same length as `x` and `y`.
        The weights are used in computing the weighted least-squares spline
        fit. If the errors in the y values have standard-deviation given by the
        vector ``d``, then `w` should be ``1/d``.
        Default is ``np.ones(m)``.
    xb, xe : float, optional
        The interval to fit.  If None, these default to ``x[0]`` and ``x[-1]``,
        respectively.
    k : int, optional
        The degree of the spline fit. It is recommended to use cubic splines,
        ``k=3``, which is the default. Even values of `k` should be avoided,
        especially with small `s` values.
    s : float, optional
        The smoothing condition. The amount of smoothness is determined by
        satisfying the LSQ (least-squares) constraint::

            sum((w * (g(x)  - y))**2 ) <= s

        where ``g(x)`` is the smoothed fit to ``(x, y)``. The user can use `s`
        to control the tradeoff between closeness to data and smoothness of fit.
        Larger `s` means more smoothing while smaller values of `s` indicate less
        smoothing.
        Recommended values of `s` depend on the weights, `w`. If the weights
        represent the inverse of the standard deviation of `y`, then a good `s`
        value should be found in the range ``(m-sqrt(2*m), m+sqrt(2*m))`` where
        ``m`` is the number of datapoints in `x`, `y`, and `w`.
        Default is ``s = 0.0``, i.e. interpolation.
    t : array_like, optional
        The spline knots. If None (default), the knots will be constructed
        automatically.
        There must be at least ``2*k + 2`` and at most ``m + k + 1`` knots.
    nest : int, optional
        The target length of the knot vector. Should be between ``2*(k + 1)``
        (the minimum number of knots for a degree-``k`` spline), and
        ``m + k + 1`` (the number of knots of the interpolating spline).
        The actual number of knots returned by this routine may be slightly
        larger than `nest`.
        Default is None (no limit, add up to ``m + k + 1`` knots).
    periodic : bool, optional
        If True, data points are considered periodic with period ``x[m-1]`` -
        ``x[0]`` and a smooth periodic spline approximation is returned. Values of
        ``y[m-1]`` and ``w[m-1]`` are not used.
        The default is False, corresponding to boundary condition 'not-a-knot'.
    bc_type : str, optional
        Boundary conditions.
        Default is `"not-a-knot"`.
        The following boundary conditions are recognized:

        * ``"not-a-knot"`` (default): The first and second segments are the
          same polynomial. This is equivalent to having ``bc_type=None``.
        * ``"periodic"``: The values and the first ``k-1`` derivatives at the
          ends are equivalent.

    Returns
    -------
    spl : a `BSpline` instance
        For `s=0`,  ``spl(x) == y``.
        For non-zero values of `s` the `spl` represents the smoothed approximation
        to `(x, y)`, generally with fewer knots.

    Notes
    -----
    This routine constructs the smoothing spline function, :math:`g(x)`, to
    minimize the sum of jumps, :math:`D_j`, of the ``k``-th derivative at the
    internal knots (:math:`x_b < t_i < x_e`), where

    .. math::

        D_i = g^{(k)}(t_i + 0) - g^{(k)}(t_i - 0)

    Specifically, the routine constructs the spline function :math:`g(x)` which
    minimizes

    .. math::

            \sum_i | D_i |^2 \to \mathrm{min}

    provided that

    .. math::

           \sum_{j=1}^m (w_j \times (g(x_j) - y_j))^2 \leqslant s ,

    where :math:`s > 0` is the input parameter.

    In other words, we balance maximizing the smoothness (measured as the jumps
    of the derivative, the first criterion), and the deviation of :math:`g(x_j)`
    from the data :math:`y_j` (the second criterion).

    Note that the summation in the second criterion is over all data points,
    and in the first criterion it is over the internal spline knots (i.e.
    those with ``xb < t[i] < xe``). The spline knots are in general a subset
    of data, see `generate_knots` for details.

    Also note the difference of this routine to `make_lsq_spline`: the latter
    routine does not consider smoothness and simply solves a least-squares
    problem

    .. math::

        \sum w_j \times (g(x_j) - y_j)^2 \to \mathrm{min}

    for a spline function :math:`g(x)` with a _fixed_ knot vector ``t``.

    Create a smoothing parametric B-spline curve with bounded error, minimizing derivative jumps.

    Given a list of N 1D arrays, `x`, which represent a curve in
    N-dimensional space parametrized by `u`, find a smooth approximating
    spline curve ``g(u)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, shape (ndim, m)
        Sampled data points representing the curve in ``ndim`` dimensions.
        The typical use is a list of 1D arrays, each of length ``m``.
    w : array_like, shape(m,), optional
        Strictly positive 1D array of weights.
        The weights are used in computing the weighted least-squares spline
        fit. If the errors in the `x` values have standard deviation given by
        the vector d, then `w` should be 1/d. Default is ``np.ones(m)``.
    u : array_like, optional
        An array of parameter values for the curve in the parametric form.
        If not given, these values are calculated automatically, according to::

            v[0] = 0
            v[i] = v[i-1] + distance(x[i], x[i-1])
            u[i] = v[i] / v[-1]

    ub, ue : float, optional
        The end-points of the parameters interval. Default to ``u[0]`` and ``u[-1]``.
    k : int, optional
        Degree of the spline. Cubic splines, ``k=3``, are recommended.
        Even values of `k` should be avoided especially with a small ``s`` value.
        Default is ``k=3``
    s : float, optional
        A smoothing condition.  The amount of smoothness is determined by
        satisfying the conditions::

            sum((w * (g(u) - x))**2) <= s,

        where ``g(u)`` is the smoothed approximation to ``x``.  The user can
        use `s` to control the trade-off between closeness and smoothness
        of fit.  Larger ``s`` means more smoothing while smaller values of ``s``
        indicate less smoothing.
        Recommended values of ``s`` depend on the weights, ``w``.  If the weights
        represent the inverse of the standard deviation of ``x``, then a good
        ``s`` value should be found in the range ``(m - sqrt(2*m), m + sqrt(2*m))``,
        where ``m`` is the number of data points in ``x`` and ``w``.
    t : array_like, optional
        The spline knots. If None (default), the knots will be constructed
        automatically.
        There must be at least ``2*k + 2`` and at most ``m + k + 1`` knots.
    nest : int, optional
        The target length of the knot vector. Should be between ``2*(k + 1)``
        (the minimum number of knots for a degree-``k`` spline), and
        ``m + k + 1`` (the number of knots of the interpolating spline).
        The actual number of knots returned by this routine may be slightly
        larger than `nest`.
        Default is None (no limit, add up to ``m + k + 1`` knots).
    bc_type : str, optional
        Boundary conditions.
        Default is `"not-a-knot"`.
        The following boundary conditions are recognized:

        * ``"not-a-knot"`` (default): The first and second segments are the
          same polynomial. This is equivalent to having ``bc_type=None``.
        * ``"periodic"``: The values and the first ``k-1`` derivatives at the
          ends are equivalent.

    Returns
    -------
    spl : a `BSpline` instance
        For `s=0`,  ``spl(u) == x``.
        For non-zero values of ``s``, `spl` represents the smoothed approximation
        to ``x``, generally with fewer knots.

    with :math:`j=1, ..., m` and :math:`\vec{x}_j = (x_{j; 1}, ..., x_{j; D})`,
    this routine constructs the parametric spline curve :math:`g_a(u)` with

    .. math::

        D_{i; a} = g_a^{(k)}(t_i + 0) - g_a^{(k)}(t_i - 0)

    where :math:`u_j` is the value of the parameter corresponding to the data point
    :math:`(x_{j; 1}, ..., x_{j; D})`, and :math:`s > 0` is the input parameter.

    In other words, we balance maximizing the smoothness (measured as the jumps
