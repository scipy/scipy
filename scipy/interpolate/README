Interpolate is a central package in SciPy, an open-source software package for scientific computing in Python which is maintained by Enthought, Inc.  Interpolate provides functionality for a variety of interpolation techniques, particularly those based on splines.


A large portion of scipy.interpolate is Python wrappers around the functionality of FITPACK, a Fortran package produced by Pleasant Valley Software for working with curves and surfaces.  Scipy.interpolate provides the following wrappers around FITPACK functions:

 splrep    -- find smoothing spline given (x,y) points on curve.
 splprep   -- find smoothing spline given parametrically defined curve.
 splev     -- evaluate the spline or its derivatives.
 splint    -- compute definite integral of a spline.
 sproot    -- find the roots of a cubic spline.
 spalde    -- compute all derivatives of a spline at given points.
 bisplrep   -- find bivariate smoothing spline representation.
 bisplev   -- evaluate bivariate smoothing spline.


Other available functions include

 UnivariateSpline             -- A more recent, object-oriented wrapper;
                                finds a (possibly smoothed) interpolating
                                spline.
 InterpolatedUnivariateSpline -- Identical to InivariateSpline, but with
				less error checking
 LSQUnivariateSpline	      -- Appears to be identical to UnivariateSplin
				with more error checking.  Uses weighted
				least squares fitting
 BivariateSpline              -- A more recent, object-oriented wrapper;
                                      finds a interpolating spline for a
                                      bivariate function.
 SmoothBivariateSpline	      -- Smooth bivariate spline approximation


A number of other functions and classes are provided, for which README documentation is forthcoming.

Introductions to interpolation and splines can be found online at:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation
	The Wikipedia article on interpolation.  Provides an accessible
	overview of major areas of the subject, including spline
	interpolation.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation
	The Wikipedia article on spline interpolation.  It is accessible
	as a conceptual introduction, and contains links to various
	algorithms, but discussion is limited to 1D interpolation.
