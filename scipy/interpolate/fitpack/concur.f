c  given the ordered set of m points x(i) in the idim-dimensional space
c  and given also a corresponding set of strictly increasing values u(i)
c  and the set of positive numbers w(i),i=1,2,...,m, subroutine concur
c  determines a smooth approximating spline curve s(u), i.e.
c      x1 = s1(u)
c      x2 = s2(u)      ub = u(1) <= u <= u(m) = ue
c      .........
c      xidim = sidim(u)
c  with sj(u),j=1,2,...,idim spline functions of odd degree k with
c  common knots t(j),j=1,2,...,n.
c  in addition these splines will satisfy the following boundary
c  constraints        (l)
c      if ib > 0 :  sj   (u(1)) = db(idim*l+j) ,l=0,1,...,ib-1
c  and                (l)
c      if ie > 0 :  sj   (u(m)) = de(idim*l+j) ,l=0,1,...,ie-1.
c  if iopt=-1 concur calculates the weighted least-squares spline curve
c  according to a given set of knots.
c  if iopt>=0 the number of knots of the splines sj(u) and the position
c  t(j),j=1,2,...,n is chosen automatically by the routine. the smooth-
c  ness of s(u) is then achieved by minimalizing the discontinuity
c  jumps of the k-th derivative of s(u) at the knots t(j),j=k+2,k+3,...,
c  n-k-1. the amount of smoothness is determined by the condition that
c  f(p)=sum((w(i)*dist(x(i),s(u(i))))**2) be <= s, with s a given non-
c  negative constant, called the smoothing factor.
c  the fit s(u) is given in the b-spline representation and can be
c  evaluated by means of subroutine curev.

c           the storage space available to the routine. nest >=2*k+2.
c           in most practical situation nest=m/2 will be sufficient.

c           in case iopt=-1, the value of n must be specified on entry.
c   t     : real array of dimension at least (nest).
c           on successful exit, this array will contain the knots of the
c           spline curve,i.e. the position of the interior knots t(k+2),

c           the b-spline representation.
c           if the computation mode iopt=1 is used, the values of t(1),
c           t(2),...,t(n) should be left unchanged between subsequent
c           calls. if the computation mode iopt=-1 is used, the values
c           t(k+2),...,t(n-k-1) must be supplied by the user, before
c           entry. see also the restrictions (ier=10).
c   nc    : integer. on entry nc must specify the actual dimension of
c           the array c as declared in the calling (sub)program. nc
c           must not be too small (see c). unchanged on exit.
c   c     : real array of dimension at least (nest*idim).
c           on successful exit, this array will contain the coefficients
c           in the b-spline representation of the spline curve s(u),i.e.
c           the b-spline coefficients of the spline sj(u) will be given
c           in c(n*(j-1)+i),i=1,2,...,n-k-1 for j=1,2,...,idim.

c           polynomial curve which satisfies the boundary constraints.
c           if the computation mode iopt =1 is used cp should be left
c           unchanged between calls.
c   np    : integer. on entry np must specify the actual dimension of
c           the array cp as declared in the calling (sub)program. np
c           must not be too small (see cp). unchanged on exit.
c   fp    : real. unless ier = 10, fp contains the weighted sum of
c           squared residuals of the spline curve returned.
c   wrk   : real array of dimension at least m*(k+1)+nest*(6+idim+3*k).
c           used as working space. if the computation mode iopt=1 is

c           used as working space. if the computation mode iopt=1 is
c           used,the values iwrk(1),...,iwrk(n) should be left unchanged
c           between subsequent calls.
c   ier   : integer. unless the routine detects an error, ier contains a
c           non-positive value on exit, i.e.
c    ier=0  : normal return. the curve returned has a residual sum of
c             squares fp such that abs(fp-s)/s <= tol with tol a relat-
c             ive tolerance set to 0.001 by the program.
c    ier=-1 : normal return. the curve returned is an interpolating
c             spline curve, satisfying the constraints (fp=0).
c    ier=-2 : normal return. the curve returned is the weighted least-
c             squares polynomial curve of degree k, satisfying the
c             constraints. in this extreme case fp gives the upper
c             bound fp0 for the smoothing factor s.
c    ier=1  : error. the required storage space exceeds the available
c             storage space, as specified by the parameter nest.
c             probably causes : nest too small. if nest is already
c             large (say nest > m/2), it may also indicate that s is
c             too small
c             the approximation returned is the least-squares spline
c             curve according to the knots t(1),t(2),...,t(n). (n=nest)
c             the parameter fp gives the corresponding weighted sum of
c             squared residuals (fp>s).
c    ier=2  : error. a theoretically impossible result was found during
c             the iteration process for finding a smoothing spline curve
c             with fp = s. probably causes : s too small.
c             there is an approximation returned but the corresponding
c             weighted sum of squared residuals does not satisfy the
c             condition abs(fp-s)/s < tol.
c    ier=3  : error. the maximal number of iterations maxit (set to 20
c             by the program) allowed for finding a smoothing curve
c             with fp=s has been reached. probably causes : s too small
c             there is an approximation returned but the corresponding
c             weighted sum of squared residuals does not satisfy the
c             condition abs(fp-s)/s < tol.
c    ier=10 : error. on entry, the input data are controlled on validity
c             the following restrictions must be satisfied.
c             -1<=iopt<=1, k = 1,3 or 5, m>k-max(0,ib-1)-max(0,ie-1),
c             nest>=2k+2, 0<idim<=10, lwrk>=(k+1)*m+nest*(6+idim+3*k),
c             nc >=nest*idim ,u(1)<u(2)<...<u(m),w(i)>0 i=1,2,...,m,
c             mx>=idim*m,0<=ib<=(k+1)/2,0<=ie<=(k+1)/2,nb>=1,ne>=1,
c             nb>=ib*idim,ne>=ib*idim,np>=2*(k+1)*idim,
c             if iopt=-1:2*k+2<=n<=min(nest,mmax) with mmax = m+k+1+
c                        max(0,ib-1)+max(0,ie-1)
c                        u(1)<t(k+2)<t(k+3)<...<t(n-k-1)<u(m)
c                       the schoenberg-whitney conditions, i.e. there
c                       must be a subset of data points uu(j) such that
c                         t(j) < uu(j) < t(j+k+1), j=1+max(0,ib-1),...
c                                                   ,n+k-1-max(0,ie-1)
c             if iopt>=0: s>=0
c                         if s=0 : nest >=mmax (see above)
c             if one of these conditions is found to be violated,control
c             is immediately repassed to the calling program. in that
c             case there is no approximation returned.
c
c  further comments:
c   by means of the parameter s, the user can control the tradeoff
c   between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit of the approximation.
c   if s is too large, the curve will be too smooth and signal will be
c   lost ; if s is too small the curve will pick up too much noise. in
c   the extreme cases the program will return an interpolating curve if
c   s=0 and the least-squares polynomial curve of degree k if s is
c   very large. between these extremes, a properly chosen s will result
c   in a good compromise between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit.
c   to decide whether an approximation, corresponding to a certain s is
c   satisfactory the user is highly recommended to inspect the fits
c   graphically.
c   recommended values for s depend on the weights w(i). if these are
c   taken as 1/d(i) with d(i) an estimate of the standard deviation of
c   x(i), a good s-value should be found in the range (m-sqrt(2*m),m+
c   sqrt(2*m)). if nothing is known about the statistical error in x(i)
c   each w(i) can be set equal to one and s determined by trial and
c   error, taking account of the comments above. the best is then to
c   start with a very large value of s ( to determine the least-squares
c   polynomial curve and the upper bound fp0 for s) and then to
c   progressively decrease the value of s ( say by a factor 10 in the
c   beginning, i.e. s=fp0/10, fp0/100,...and more carefully as the
c   approximating curve shows more detail) to obtain closer fits.
c   to economize the search for a good s-value the program provides with
c   different modes of computation. at the first call of the routine, or
c   whenever he wants to restart with the initial set of knots the user
c   must set iopt=0.
c   if iopt=1 the program will continue with the set of knots found at
c   the last call of the routine. this will save a lot of computation
c   time if concur is called repeatedly for different values of s.
c   the number of knots of the spline returned and their location will
c   depend on the value of s and on the complexity of the shape of the
c   curve underlying the data. but, if the computation mode iopt=1 is
c   used, the knots returned may also depend on the s-values at previous
c   calls (if these were smaller). therefore, if after a number of
c   trials with different s-values and iopt=1, the user can finally
c   accept a fit as satisfactory, it may be worthwhile for him to call
c   concur once more with the selected value for s but now with iopt=0.
c   indeed, concur may then return an approximation of the same quality
c   of fit but with fewer knots and therefore better if data reduction
c   is also an important objective for the user.
c
c   the form of the approximating curve can strongly be affected by
c   the choice of the parameter values u(i). if there is no physical
c   reason for choosing a particular parameter u, often good results
c   will be obtained with the choice
c        v(1)=0, v(i)=v(i-1)+q(i), i=2,...,m, u(i)=v(i)/v(m), i=1,..,m
c   where
c        q(i)= sqrt(sum j=1,idim (xj(i)-xj(i-1))**2 )
c   other possibilities for q(i) are
c        q(i)= sum j=1,idim (xj(i)-xj(i-1))**2
c        q(i)= sum j=1,idim abs(xj(i)-xj(i-1))
c        q(i)= max j=1,idim abs(xj(i)-xj(i-1))
c        q(i)= 1
