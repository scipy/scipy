New features
 - Added option 'Qt' to triangulate non-simplicial facets
 - Added option 'TI file' to input data from file
 - Added option 'Q10' to prevent special processing for narrow distributions
        e.g., RBOX 1000 L100000 s G1e-6 t1001803691 | QHULL Tv Q10
 - Tried to compute Voronoi volumes ('Pv'). Requires dual face graph--not easy
        See Clarkson's hull program for code.

 - If 'T4', print facet lists and check polygon after adding each point

Corrections to code
 - rbox: allow 'c' and 'd' with 's r', meshes, etc.
 - qh_findbest: redesigned as directed search. qh_findbesthorizon for coplanar
      qh_findbest is faster for many distributions

      needed for distributions with a sharp edge,
          e.g., rbox 1000 s Z1 G1e-13 | qhull Tv
 - qh_findbest/qh_findbestnew: search neighbors of better horizon facets
      was needed for RBOX 1000 s Z1 G1e-13 t996564279 | qhull Tv
      and RBOX 1000 s W1e-13 P0 t996547055 | QHULL d Qbb Qc Tv
 - qh_findbest with noupper: could return an upperdelaunay facet if dist>qh.MINoutside.
 - qh_findbestnew: allow facet->upperdelaunay if dist > qh.MINoutside
 - qh_partitioncoplanar: call qh_partitionpoint if outside and perpendicular
      for distributions with a sharp edge
 - qh_partitionvisible: report precision error if all newfacets degenerate.
      was needed for RBOX 1000 s W1e-13 t995138628 | QHULL d
 - qh_createsimplex: clears qh.num_visible, may be non-zero with 'TRn QJ'

Changes to prompts, warnings, and statistics
 - For Delaunay & Voronoi, 's' reports deleted vertices due to facet merging.
   They were incorrectly reported as nearly incident points.

 - reviewed time profile.  Qhull is slower.  Optimized qh_findbestnew()
 - qh_addpoint: Added warning note about avoiding a local minimum
 - qh_checkpolygon: report qh.facet_next error if NARROWhull & dist>MINoutside
 - qh_findbest: renamed "newfacets" parameter to "isnewfacets" since it is boolT

 - qh_findbestsharp: replaced with qh_sharpnewfacets followed by qh_findbestnew
 - qh_partitionpoint, Delaunay sites can not be inside.  Otherwise points may
       be outside upperDelaunay facets yet not near-inside Delaunay facets
       See: RBOX s 1000 t993602376 | QHULL C-1e-3 d  Qbb FA Tv
 - qh_partitioncoplanar: call qh_findbest/qh_findbestnew with qh DELAUNAY

 - qh_printvertex: format long lines
 - user.h: tightened qh_WARNnarrow and qh_MAXnarrow.  Do not see problems
       until they are -1.0.
 - user.h: defined qh_DISToutside, qh_SEARCHdist, and qh_USEfindbestnew
 - qh_checkfacet: in 3-d, allow #ridges > #vertices.  Can get a vertex twice

            A new flag, qh UPPERdelaunay, was defined for 'Qu'.
         Please set qh ATinfinity if you explicitly add the point "at-infinity"
         Please set qh ATinfinity if you explicitly call qh_projectinput.
         Please set qh UPPERdelaunay if you explicitly cleared qh ATinfinity.
         Other users do not need to change their code.
   Now you can build a Delaunay triangulation without creating a point
   "at-infinity".  This removes a potential, hard-to-understand error.
   qh_readpoints sets qh ATinfinity for options 'd' or 'v' without 'Qu'.
   qh_initB sets qh ATinfinity for qh PROJECTdelaunay w/o qh UPPERdelaunay.

qhull V2.2 95/12/4
 - Version 2.2 fixes an important bug in computing Delaunay triangulations
   and convex hulls with edges sharper than ninety degrees.  The problem
   occurs when processing a point at a sharp edge.  A directed search can
   not be used for partitioning because one side may hide facets from the
   other side.  The new lens-shaped distribution for rbox demonstrates the
   problem.  For example, 'rbox 100 L3 G0.5 s | qhull Tv' fails for Version 2.1.
   O. Schramm found the bug when computing the Delaunay triangulation of points
   near an outside edge.

   I rewrote qh_findbest and related functions.  Qh_findbest
   uses an exhaustive test for sharp edges (qh_findbest_sharp).
   Qh_findbest avoids the upper convex hull of Delaunay triangulations.

   Options 'd' and 'v' no longer assign coplanar points to the upper convex hull.

   Qh_check_maxout tests near-inside points.  It ignores fully inside points.
   When done, it removes near-inside points from the coplanar sets.

   If you use qh_addpoint or qh_findbest, please review the function headers.
   They do not work for lens-shaped hulls for arbitrary facets.  They do work for
   Delaunay triangulations.

 Changes to options for V2.2
 - added 'Qu' for computing the furthest-site Delaunay triangulation (upper hull)
   and furthest-site Voronoi vertices.
 - added 'FP' to print nearest vertex for coplanar points
 - added coplanar count to 'Fs' and 's'
 - added number of similar points to summary for Delaunay/Voronoi
 - Option 'Qc' is no longer necessary when merging.
 - 'o' format for Voronoi vertices ('v') generates "0" lines for similar points
 - 'QRn' for Delaunay ('d' or 'v') now rotates about the Z axis (see qh_init_B).
   Otherwise Qhull does not identify the upper hull
 - removed option 'Qa' for "all points outside".  In V2.1 it was automatically
   set for 'd'.  Even though it was a bad idea, it revealed the above bug.
 - for option list ('FO'), added version, values for one-merge, maxpos, maxneg,
   and near-inside, and flags for zero-centrum
 - optimized 'C-0' and 'Qx'.  These options ("zero-centrum") test vertices
   instead of centrums for adjacent simplicial facets.
 - if 'Tv', report number of points that are not verified due to qh_findbest
 - Option 'Q8' ignores near-inside points.

 rbox 95/12/3
 - added lens distribution ('Ln')  It may be used with 's', 'r', 'Wn', and 'Gn'
 - removed default point count except for the test case, 'Dn'

 - added code fragment for visiting Voronoi vertices to "Calling Qhull" [M. Downes]
 - added note about qh_addpoint() to "Calling Qhull" [M. Downes]

 Errors fixed for V2.2
 - use qh_sethyperplane_gauss if 3-d or 4-d norm is less than qh MINnorm
 - count Zcentrumtests if qh_NOstat
 - reversed sign convention for qh_sethyperplane_gauss
   it was opposite to qh_sethyperplane_det
   this effects qh_determinant and qh_detsimplex
 - fixed error in qh_findgood_all with multiple restrictions, e.g., 'QVn Pdk'
 - fixed call to qh_clearcenters for qh_produce_output
 - in qh_errexit, report p0 if last furthest point

 Changes for users of the Qhull library
 - user code needs to define qh_version (see user_eg.c)

 - changed BoolT to unsigned int (prevent implicit enum conversion warnings)
 - added upperdelaunay to facetT.  It indicates a facet of the upper convex hull.
 - converted qhull-PPC.sit for CodeWarrior 7

 Code changes for V2.2
 - simplified calls to setjmp() for Cray J916 [Salazar & Velez]

  - added 'Q4' to avoid merges of old facets into new facets (does worse)
  - added 'Q5' to skip qh_check_maxout (faster, but less accurate)
  - added 'Q6' to skip pre-merge of concave and coplanar facets
  - added 'Qv' for testing vertex neighbors for convexity (needs merge option)
  - added warning if mix Geomview output with other outputs ('Po' turns off)

      should use qh_printallstatistics instead
  - qh_findbest uses boolT for newfacets

  - in qh_check_maxout, inside points may be added to coplanar list.
  - qh_findbestnew used for qh_partitionall.  It is faster.

      MINvisible is the default MAXcoplanar.
  - cleaned up list management via qh_resetlists
  - uses facet->dupridge to indicate duplicated ridges instead of ->seen
  - qh_buildtracing records CPU time relative to qh hulltime instead of 0

                ========== changes to merging =======
  - many performance improvements, especially in high-d.
  - when merging, qh_findbest and qh_findbestnew stops search at qh_DISToutside
  - vertex neighbors delayed until first merge
  - post merges reported every TFn/2 merges
  - vertex merging turned off in 7-d and higher (lots of work, no benefit).
      vertex merging moved to qh_qhull_postmerging in 6-d.
  - replaced qh min_vertex with MAXcoplanar for determining coplanarity
  - pick closest facets to merge in duplicate ridge instead of flip/flip
      (see qh_matchduplicates in poly2.c)
  - optimize merge of simplex into a facet
  - optimize merge of a "samecycle" of facets into a coplanar horizon facet
  - cleaned up qh_forcedmerges/qh_flippedmerges and removed facet->newmerge

  - qh_facetdegen replaced by facet->degenredun
  - flipped neighbors no longer merged in preference to flip/non-flip pairs
  - removed angle argument from qh_merge_degenredundant and qh_mergefacet

  - added hull_dim factor to qh_BESTcentrum
  - removed horizon preference in qh_merge_nonconvex (qh AVOIDold)
  - facet->keepcentrum if qh WIDEfacet or qh_MAXnewcentrum extra vertices

------------
qhull V2.02 1/25/95
  - rbox 'z' prints integer coordinates, use 'Bn' to change range
  - fixed rare bug in qh_check_maxout when qh_bestfacet returns NULL
  - fixed performance bug in findbestneighbor, should be + BESTnonconvex
  - renamed 'notgood' flag in 'f' option to 'notG' flag (caused confusion)
  - changed qh.hulltime to (unsigned) to prevent negative CPU times
  - added random perturbations to qh_getangle under the 'Rn' option
  - reviewed the documentation and enhancement list
  - added discussion of how to intersect halfspaces using qhull
  - replaced expression that caused incorrect code under an old version of gcc
  - added buffer after qh.errexit in case 'jmp_buf' has the wrong size
  - rewrote qh_printhelp_singular for lower-dimensional inputs
  - rewrote qh_printhelp_degenerate
  - added options for qh_RANDOMint in qhull_a.h
  - changed time format for 'TFn' to %02d

------------
qhull V2.01 6/20/94
  - fixed bug in qh_matchnewfacets that occured when memory alignment makes
    facet->neighbors larger than necessary.
  - fixed bug in computing worst-case simplicial merge of angle coplanar
    facets (ONEmerge).  This decreases (...x) in printsummary.

qhull V2.01 6/17/94
  - added recommendation for 'Qcm' to documentation and help prompts
  - added an input warning to qh_check_points ('Tv') if coplanars and no 'Qc'
  - qh_partitionpoint: always counts coplanar partitions (Zcoplanarpart)
  - rewrote qh_printhelp_degenerate to emphasize option 'C-0'
  - For Geomview output, roundoff is not needed when printing the inner and
    outer planes.  This improves Geomview output for the 'Rn' option.
  - For Geomview output without coplanar points or vertices, qh_GEOMepislon
    is not needed.  This removes the edge gap when displaying a Voronoi cell.
  - For Geomview output 'Gp', direct vertices to the interior point
    instead of the arithmetic center of the displayed vertices.

qhull V2.01 6/11/94
  - if pre-merge, 'Qf' is automatically set.  Otherwise an outside point may
        be dropt by qh_findbest().  This slows down partitioning.
  - always use 'Qc' if merging and all facet->maxoutside's must be right.
        Otherwise distributions with many coplanar points may occassionally
        miss a coplanar point for a facet.  This is because qh_findbest, when
        called by qh_check_maxout, can become stuck at a local maximum if
        the search is started at an arbitrary facet.  With 'Qc', the search
        is started from a coplanar facet.  For example,
                rbox 1000 W8e-6 t | qhull C-0 Tv
        will (rarely) report that a facet->minoutside is incorrect
  - option 'Pp' turns off "Verifying" message for 'Tv'
  - added qh_copynonconvex to qh_renameridgevertex (fixes rare error)
  - 'rbox tn' sets random seed to n
  - 'rbox t' reports random seed in comment line
  - qh_errexit reports rbox_command | qhull_command and 'QR' random seed
  - added additional tracing to bestdist and setfacetplane
  - in qh_checkconvex, need to test coplanar against 0 instead of -DISTround
  - in qh_checkconvex, always test centrums if merging.  The opposite
    vertex of a simplicial facet may be coplanar since a vertex of
    a simplicial facet may be above the facet's hyperplane.
  - fixed error handling in qh_checkconvex when merging
  - in qh_printsummary, one merge ratio not printed if less than 'Wn'
  - documented that 'Tv' verifies all facet->maxoutside

qhull V2.01 6/2/94
  - 's' prints summary to stderr
  - multiple output formats printed in order to stdout
  - added statistic for worst-case distance for merging simplicial facets
        can not hope for a better "max distance above/below facet"
        print factor for "max distance.."/"merge simplicial" in printsummary
  - fixed error in scaling input with min/max reversed ('Qb0:1B0:-1')
  - fixed error in scaling if project & Delaunay & scale ('d Qb0:0B1:0b2:0')
  - user_eg.c: qh_delpoint removed since it does not always work
  - user_eg.c now works for either convex hull or Delaunay triangulation
  - added PROJECTdelaunay for Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi diagrams
        with libqhull.a and user_eg.c
  - user_eg.c: if project or scale input, need to copy points
  - user_eg.c: default just defines main, added fprintf's for qh_errprint etc.
  - qh_gausselim: a 0 pivot no longer zeros the rest of the array,
          need the remaining elements for area computation
  - qh_qhull: restore cos_max, centrum_radius at end of POSTmerging
  - qh_checkflipped with !allerror is >=0.0 instead of >0.0
  - removed -Wall from gcc due to unnecesssary "warning: implicit declaration"
  - renamed 'new' variables and fields to allow compilation by g++
  - added README notes on C++, and "size isn't known"
  - updated manual on 'Qg' with coplanar facets and no merging ('rbox c D7')
      'Qg Pg' and 'Pg' produce different results because of precision problems

------------

  - 'rbox r s Z G' no longer includes the positive pole
  - no changes to the Macintosh version
