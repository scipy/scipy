    Perturb points in :math:`[0, 1]^d` using Lloyd-Max algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : array_like (n, d)
        The points to iterate on. With ``n`` the number of points and ``d``
        the dimension.
    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance for termination. If the min of the L1-norm over the points
        changes less than `tol`, it stops the algorithm. Default is 1e-5.
    maxiter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations. It will stop the algorithm even if
        `tol` is above the threshold.
        Too many iterations tend to cluster the points as a hypersphere.
        Default is 10.
    decay : {float, array_like (maxiter)}, optional
        Relaxation decay. A positive value would move the points toward
        their centroid, and negative value would move them away.
        1 would move the points to their centroid. Default is a varying
        exponential decay starting at 2 and ending at 1 after `maxiter`.
    qhull_options : str, optional
        Additional options to pass to Qhull. See Qhull manual
        for details. (Default: "Qbb Qc Qz Qj Qx" for ndim > 4 and
        "Qbb Qc Qz Qj" otherwise.)

    Returns
    -------
    points : array_like (n, d)
        The points after being processed by Lloyd-Max algorithm.

    Notes
    -----
    Lloyd-Max algorithm is an iterative process with the purpose of improving
    the dispersion of points. For given points: (i) compute a Voronoi
    Tessellation; (ii) find the centroid of each Voronoi cell; (iii) move the
    points toward the centroid of their respective cell. See [1]_, [2]_.

    The process converges to equally spaced points. It implies that measures
    like the discrepancy could suffer from too many iterations. On the other
    hand, L1 and L2 distances should improve. This is especially true with
    QMC methods which tend to favor the discrepancy over other criteria.

    .. note::

        The current implementation does not intersect the Voronoi Tessellation
        with the boundaries. This implies that for a low number of points,
        empirically below 20, no Voronoi cell is touching the boundaries.
        Hence points cannot be moved close to the boundaries.

        Further improvements could consider the points at infinity so that
        all boundaries are segments of some Voronoi cells. This would fix
        the computation of the centroid position.

    .. warning::

       The Voronoi Tessellation step is expensive and quickly becomes
       intractable with dimensions as low as 10 even for a sample of points
       of size as low as 1000.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.spatial.distance import cdist
    >>> from scipy.spatial import lloyd_centroidal_voronoi_tessellation
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> points = rng.random((128, 2))

    .. note::

        The points need to be in :math:`[0, 1]^d`. `scipy.stats.qmc.scale`
        can be used to scale the points from their
        original bounds to :math:`[0, 1]^d`. And back to their original bounds.

    Compute the quality of the points using the L1 criterion.

    >>> def l1_norm(points):
    ...    l1 = cdist(points, points, 'cityblock')
    ...    return np.min(l1[l1.nonzero()])

    >>> l1_norm(points)
    0.00161...  # random

    Now process the points using Lloyd's algorithm and check the improvement
    on the L1. The value should increase.

    >>> points = lloyd_centroidal_voronoi_tessellation(points)
    >>> l1_norm(points)
    0.0278...  # random
