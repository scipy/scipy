# Note that in maintenance branches, all build dependencies should
# have an upper bound equal to the most recent already-released version
# of the dependency. This to prevent that a future backwards-incompatible
# release will break the source build of a SciPy release.
# Do accept micro (bug-fix) releases. So for example, if pybind11 2.4.3 is
# the most recent version on PyPI:
#
#     "pybind11>=2.4.3,<2.5.0",
#
# Upper bounds in release branches must have notes on why they are added.
# Distro packages can ignore upper bounds added only to prevent future
# breakage; if we add pins or bounds because of known problems then they need
# them too.

# Run tools/generate_requirements.txt when making changes to any dependencies
